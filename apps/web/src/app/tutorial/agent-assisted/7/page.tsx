## Requirements (Brenner disciplines)

1) **Discriminative tests only (⊘ Exclusion Test):**
   - Propose tests where at least two hypotheses predict different outcomes.
   - Each test must specify: what observation would EXCLUDE which hypothesis.

2) **Potency check each test (🎭):**
   - If the test comes back null/negative, what do we learn?
   - If the test is likely to be ambiguous, rewrite it until it isn't.

3) **Keep the hypothesis space honest (Σ + ⟳):**
   - Ensure hypotheses are not level-mixed (Σ Level Split).
   - Ensure at least one genuine third alternative is included (⟳ Object Transpose).

4) **Scale sanity (⊙):**
   - Where relevant, include order-of-magnitude or numeric plausibility checks.

---

## Output format (strict)

Produce a single markdown artifact with these sections:

1. **Single triangulated kernel** (3–6 bullets): your best current hypothesis + the single most discriminative next test + why.
2. **Hypothesis slate (revised)**: 4+ hypotheses, each with mechanism + 1–2 key assumptions.
3. **Discriminative tests (ranked)**: a table with:
   - Test name
   - What you do / measure
   - Predictions if H1/H2/H3/... true
   - Exclusion logic (what outcome rules out what)
   - Potency check (🎭)
   - Feasibility (time/cost/skill)
4. **Assumption ledger (updated)**: grouped by hypothesis and by type (theoretical / methodological / background).
5. **Adversarial critique**: attack the framing; propose 1–2 alternative framings.
6. **Recommended next steps**: the next 3 actions, ordered by discriminative power.

Take your time and be ruthless about discriminative power.`;

          This is where the method becomes operational: your agent turns the hypothesis slate into
          discriminative tests, ranks them by potency, and produces a complete research artifact.
        </p>

        <Important>
          Don&apos;t accept weak tests. The point is not to &quot;gather more information&quot; — it&apos;s to
          design tests that can actually exclude hypotheses.

        <ProTip>
          If the agent produces a huge artifact, ask it to additionally output a one-screen
          &quot;single triangulated kernel&quot; summary: best current hypothesis + best next test + why.

[YOUR REFINED QUESTION FROM STEP 5]

Please generate the following artifacts:

## 1. Hypothesis Slate (minimum 4 hypotheses)

For each hypothesis:
- State it clearly and specifically
- Explain the mechanism it proposes
- Note what evidence would support it
- Note what evidence would falsify it

Include at least:
- The "obvious" hypothesis (what most people would assume)
- A mechanistic alternative (different underlying mechanism)
- A reversed causation hypothesis (effect causes apparent cause)
- A third-variable hypothesis (both are caused by something else)

Use **Object Transpose (⟳)** to generate the reversal and third-variable options.

## 2. Assumption Ledger

List every assumption underlying each hypothesis. Categorize them as:
- **Theoretical**: Assumptions about how things work
- **Methodological**: Assumptions about how we'd measure/observe
- **Background**: Taken-for-granted facts that might be wrong

Use **Level Split (Σ)** to check if assumptions hold at different levels.

## 3. Third Alternatives

For any pair of hypotheses that seem like the only options, generate a third possibility that:
- Is neither hypothesis A nor hypothesis B
- Could explain the same observations
- Comes from applying Object Transpose or Level Split

## 4. Critical Evaluation

For each hypothesis, apply **Scale Check (⊙)** to verify:
- Is the proposed effect size plausible?
- Do the numbers make physical/biological sense?
- What would have to be true for this mechanism to work?

## Requirements (Brenner disciplines)

1) **Discriminative tests only (⊘ Exclusion Test):**
   - Propose tests where at least two hypotheses predict different outcomes.
   - Each test must specify: what observation would EXCLUDE which hypothesis.

2) **Potency check each test (🎭):**
   - If the test comes back null/negative, what do we learn?
   - If the test is likely to be ambiguous, rewrite it until it isn't.

3) **Keep the hypothesis space honest (Σ + ⟳):**
   - Ensure hypotheses are not level-mixed (Σ Level Split).
   - Ensure at least one genuine third alternative is included (⟳ Object Transpose).

4) **Scale sanity (⊙):**
   - Where relevant, include order-of-magnitude or numeric plausibility checks.

---

## Output format (strict)

Produce a single markdown artifact with these sections:

1. **Single triangulated kernel** (3–6 bullets): your best current hypothesis + the single most discriminative next test + why.
2. **Hypothesis slate (revised)**: 4+ hypotheses, each with mechanism + 1–2 key assumptions.
3. **Discriminative tests (ranked)**: a table with:
   - Test name
   - What you do / measure
   - Predictions if H1/H2/H3/... true
   - Exclusion logic (what outcome rules out what)
   - Potency check (🎭)
   - Feasibility (time/cost/skill)
4. **Assumption ledger (updated)**: grouped by hypothesis and by type (theoretical / methodological / background).
5. **Adversarial critique**: attack the framing; propose 1–2 alternative framings.
6. **Recommended next steps**: the next 3 actions, ordered by discriminative power.

Take your time and be ruthless about discriminative power.`,

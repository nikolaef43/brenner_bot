[YOUR REFINED QUESTION FROM STEP 5]

Please generate the following artifacts:

## 1. Hypothesis Slate (minimum 4 hypotheses)

For each hypothesis:
- State it clearly and specifically
- Explain the mechanism it proposes
- Note what evidence would support it
- Note what evidence would falsify it

Include at least:
- The "obvious" hypothesis (what most people would assume)
- A mechanistic alternative (different underlying mechanism)
- A reversed causation hypothesis (effect causes apparent cause)
- A third-variable hypothesis (both are caused by something else)

Use **Object Transpose (⟳)** to generate the reversal and third-variable options.

## 2. Assumption Ledger

List every assumption underlying each hypothesis. Categorize them as:
- **Theoretical**: Assumptions about how things work
- **Methodological**: Assumptions about how we'd measure/observe
- **Background**: Taken-for-granted facts that might be wrong

Use **Level Split (Σ)** to check if assumptions hold at different levels.

## 3. Third Alternatives

For any pair of hypotheses that seem like the only options, generate a third possibility that:
- Is neither hypothesis A nor hypothesis B
- Could explain the same observations
- Comes from applying Object Transpose or Level Split

## 4. Critical Evaluation

For each hypothesis, apply **Scale Check (⊙)** to verify:
- Is the proposed effect size plausible?
- Do the numbers make physical/biological sense?
- What would have to be true for this mechanism to work?

Take your time. Be thorough. This is the foundation for everything that follows.`,

## Requirements (Brenner disciplines)

1) **Discriminative tests only (⊘ Exclusion Test):**
   - Propose tests where at least two hypotheses predict different outcomes.
   - Each test must specify: what observation would EXCLUDE which hypothesis.

2) **Potency check each test (🎭):**
   - If the test comes back null/negative, what do we learn?
   - If the test is likely to be ambiguous, rewrite it until it isn't.

3) **Keep the hypothesis space honest (Σ + ⟳):**
   - Ensure hypotheses are not level-mixed (Σ Level Split).
   - Ensure at least one genuine third alternative is included (⟳ Object Transpose).

4) **Scale sanity (⊙):**
   - Where relevant, include order-of-magnitude or numeric plausibility checks.

---

## Output format (strict)

Produce a single markdown artifact with these sections:

1. **Single triangulated kernel** (3–6 bullets): your best current hypothesis + the single most discriminative next test + why.
2. **Hypothesis slate (revised)**: 4+ hypotheses, each with mechanism + 1–2 key assumptions.
3. **Discriminative tests (ranked)**: a table with:
   - Test name
   - What you do / measure
   - Predictions if H1/H2/H3/... true
   - Exclusion logic (what outcome rules out what)
   - Potency check (🎭)
   - Feasibility (time/cost/skill)
4. **Assumption ledger (updated)**: grouped by hypothesis and by type (theoretical / methodological / background).
5. **Adversarial critique**: attack the framing; propose 1–2 alternative framings.
6. **Recommended next steps**: the next 3 actions, ordered by discriminative power.

Take your time and be ruthless about discriminative power.`,
  explanation: `This is the core prompt that produces the research artifact. The strict output
format ensures consistency across sessions. The Brenner disciplines section reminds the agent
of key principles. The potency check requirement prevents weak tests. The "single triangulated
kernel" forces prioritization rather than listing everything equally.`,

Confusion arises when you mix levels or try to explain one level purely in terms of another. Distinguish program from interpreter, message from machine, specification from execution.",

      "The operator 𝓛 transforms data or problems into a different representation where the answer becomes obvious. What's hidden in one encoding may be obvious in another. Especially powerful: reduce dimensionality from 3D to 1D when possible.",

    long:
      "In lysogeny, a temperate phage inserts its DNA into the bacterial chromosome, becoming a prophage. The phage genes are replicated with the host DNA and can later be induced to enter the lytic cycle.",

    term: "Transduction",
    short: "Transfer of bacterial genes from one cell to another via phage.",

    short: "Genetic steam engineering: solving problems by exhaustive screening.",
    long:

    short: "Building function by adding genes rather than removing them.",
    long:

    why:

**Why this matters:**
Before generating alternatives, we need to clearly state what we're questioning.
Your hypothesis proposes that X causes Y. But what if that's not the whole story?

Consider:
- Is the direction of causation clear?
- Could other factors be involved?
- How strong is your evidence for X → Y specifically?

**Selection Effects:** Who ends up in your study?

A good test should give different results depending on which explanation is true.

For each high-plausibility alternative, consider:
1. What observation would support the original hypothesis?
2. What observation would support the alternative?
3. Is such an observation feasible?

The best tests have clear, distinguishable predictions for each explanation.

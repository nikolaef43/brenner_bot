## 1. Coming from Eastern European stock

> Both my parents had come to South Africa from Russia. My father came from Lithuania, and he came to South Africa in 1910. It was a matter of sheer luck that he didn't go to America, 'cause he had a sister in America and his brother was in South Africa – his older brother – and when he got to London, he only had enough money for the boat to Cape Town, which was half the fare to New York, so he took that.
>
> His brother, who is someone I remembered very well, was much older than him and had come to South Africa about 20 years before that and was... had served in the Tzar's army in the Crimea in about 1870, 1880. And my father actually left to escape conscription to the army, which is most people... which is what the fate of most people was.
>
> My mother came to South Africa in 1922. She came from Latvia; she came from a town called Dvinsk; so she had lived through the entire period of the war and the revolution. My grandfather was an old Bolshevik who had left Russia in... prior to this, about 1907, and of course the family lived throughout the... the war and so on.
>
> My father actually left a brother in Russia and he and his family died of the famine in 1923 in a town called... which was then called Ekatrinograd *[sic]* and I think is now called Ekatrinograd *[sic]* again, but I believe it got changed to Gorky in the meantime, however – one of those things – so... and this... people had come to South Africa and my father had settled in a town just outside Johannesburg called **Germiston** where I was born.
>
> My father was a shoe repairer – cobbler – and we lived in a... two rooms at the back of his shop, as many people lived in those days. Next door was a... a plumber who'd also come from Eastern Europe, and they also lived in the back of the shop, but they... they advanced economically much more rapidly than we did.

---

## 2. Mother and father

> Well, my father was a shoemaker and not a well-educated man; he couldn't read or write at all, I mean, till the day he died. He had a great aptitude for languages and so he learnt and spoke two African languages: Afrikaans...

*[Q] But he couldn't read or write?*

> Could not read or write. My mother taught herself to read and write, so she was the only one who could speak English. In fact, when my father finally had to get naturalised, because, you know, none of this... we had to get a lawyer to get the forms filled out because he couldn't read or write, so that was the... that was his background.

*[Q] Was he a shoemaker till the end of his life?*

> Yes, yes, right till the very end, he went on working till he was over 80; wouldn't give it up. Everybody said, 'It's ridiculous', but he still had his little shop and went on doing this because... one of the people who felt that if you stopped work, you... you might as well just stop living.

*[Q] What did he feel about your science?*

> Well, he... you know, he didn't understand it, but he could understand why I was doing it; let's put it this way... and of course my mother never forgave me for not becoming a specialist – you know a doctor – but... but of course never tried to stop me basically. Well, I suppose they couldn't have done it anyway. So that was...

*[Q] Did your mother ever work?*

> No, my mother was always at home, you know, and looked after... looked after this... looked after the family and of course from a completely different... I mean, all that I... I can remember was, you know the great... the stories I used to hear about what it was like to be in Russia between, say, 1914 and 1922 – whenever she got out, you know – and there's these terrible stories of their... of this town which there were, you know, Red Latvians and White Latvians and Red Russians and White Russians; it exchanged hands almost every time.
>
> And the story I do remember being told as a young child was a story of one being sent to get bread and standing in line and finally getting half a loaf of bread, but by the time this... this child had walked home with this bread, had... by taking a little bit, had eaten the entire loaf, and the family waiting for this bread got nothing; it was empty. But, you know, one learnt about food being made with potato peelings but... and of course to... to hear all of this in... in Germiston; things that were going on was like getting news from an alien planet. I mean, first of all there was never any snow, so the concept of what was it like to live through a really hard north, northern winter, this just had no connection with us, so... and I think the kind of picture that you draw of the world from stories or from what you read is so false that, you know, one... one can never grasp it when one sees it in reality again that one's image of it was so wrong.

*[Q] Were they religious?*

> My mother was fairly orthodox; my father was a total agnostic. He didn't... he didn't practice anything and was against it all. My mother was of course... practised everything, and of course for a long time we had my grandmother living with us who spoke no English and spoke Russian and Yiddish only. So I learnt as a child to speak some Russian, because it was quite interesting. One always knew that when the parents and the grandmother spoke Russian, this was something they didn't want us to hear, so it became very important to try and find out what it was. So it was that kind of background.

## 3. Where did the insult 'Peruvian Jew' come from

> I think that to try and understand what the whole of this culture, or this immigrant culture in Johannesburg, was... it can be very easily illustrated by an original piece of sociological research that I conducted after I came to England. I was... met some people who said they'd met some nice South Africans who had come from Johannesburg and they were talking about mutual friends of them... of theirs, and the South African said, 'Oh, those Peruvians'. So they said, 'Well, we then went to the other people when we met them and said, "We didn't know you came from Peru", and they got very upset'.
>
> Now, I said to them, 'Don't worry, you know, this is a... this is a term of... of abuse and in fact it means... it's a kind of Jew who is stingy, mean, uneducated, uncultured'. And they said, 'But how... what on earth is the connection with Peru?' So I said, 'Well, look, I don't know, I've never thought about it until now, but I will do some research'.
>
> So I went and did research and the long story can be cut short. The following is the true origins of this word, because it was clear it was impossible for 90% of South African Jews to have come from Peru; that was inconceivable. I then discovered that when the immigrants came, there had been prior to this great movement at the turn of the century – the first 20 years – there had been a much earlier immigration of Jews from... largely from Germany, who of course were financiers and, incidentally, the same history is the same as the one in America. Namely the earlier immigrants, the Lehmans and so on, who'd come from Germany, were succeeded later by the East European ones.
>
> The people who had come from Eastern Europe decided to form an organisation which was called in Yiddish the **Polnischer und Russischer Yiddische Verein**, abbreviated to **PERUV** – Polnischer und Russischer Yiddische Verein. PERUV. And the people who attended this club came to be called *Peruvnics*, which fits, but later this had become anglicised, as indeed you know; Simon turned into Seymour, and, you know, all the names that come... and so they were called Peruvians. It was a much more gentile... hence the origin of the word Peruvian Jew. It only has... nothing to do with Peru but with origins in Eastern Europe and reflects exactly the age-old disdain that the German Jews had felt for the Eastern European immigrants – the Eastern European co-religionists.
>
> And that was that story, then, and... and of course it was amazing to me in later life to find that the same cultural thing had been gone through in exactly the same way in... in America. Later, when I got to know Ed Shils very well and went to visit with him in Chicago, exactly the same kind of history took place in Chicago between the earlier immigrants and the later people from Eastern Europe, who did that.

## 4. Early memories of living in a shop

> We had lived in the back of the shop, and I have this memory of playing on the floor, and still can remember the smell of leather that dominates my entire early life.

*[Q] Were you an only child, Sydney?*

> No, I had a sister who... my... my sister was two years younger than me, so she was born much later, and, of course, I should have mentioned, I was born on **13th January 1927**.

---

## 5. Learning to read from the tablecloth

> I learnt to read at a very early age because round the corner from us, again, there was a... a lady whose husband had been a tailor and she had died. But she had known my mother's family from Latvia because they'd all come from the same time – as it was called there, *Landsleute*; that is, all people who originated from the same thing – and I had gone... and I spent quite a lot of time with her. She lived in a tiny room where she cooked for herself, and she taught me to read from the newspapers that were on the table – which of course in lieu of tablecloths – and this is where I learned to read; so that by the age of four, I could read quite fluently.

---

## 6. Accelerated early schooling

> My father had a customer – a lady called Mrs McCartney – and they came into the shop – I must have been about four and a half – and she found me reading, and she said to my father that I should be sent to kindergarten and my father said that he couldn't afford it, but she said she would take me into this kindergarten. This kindergarten was run as part of the Presbyterian Church, in Germiston, and so I started going to kindergarten when I was five years old, and I did the first three years of... I was... very rapidly started... moved into the standard school curriculum, and so I did the first three years of what would be grade school in one year. So I did grade I, grade II and standard I, as they were called in South Africa, in one year, and then I went to the state school, the **Germiston Junior School**, and so I started at the age of six in standard II. So I was very far in advance of my age.

---

## 7. Libraries

> And of course the most interesting thing that I can recall from one of those is of course discovering the public library. A man called **Andrew Carnegie** was a great... a great donor to the world because he gave money to set up public libraries, and Germiston had a public library – the Carnegie it was called – and so getting in there and finding the world of books. So the world of books has always been very important – there were no books at home of course – and I rapidly graduated to the adult library, and of course I read voraciously about lots of things.

---

## 8. The early books that inspired me to do chemistry

> But one of the early books... there are two early books that I read while I went through school which were in the field of science and which I remember very clearly. One was called *The Young Chemist*, and this was a book by a man called Sherwood Taylor, and it gave wonderful recipes for how to do chemistry experiments, and I lost my copy of that unfortunately, but I'd started doing chemistry at the age of 10.
>
> By this time we had changed our houses and had moved into the house in the southern parts of Germiston – so that was 1937 – where there was a garage and which... we didn't have a car, and that's when I started to do chemistry in a serious way. It was very difficult of course to get apparatus and... and this, but I saved my money and bought a test-tube every two weeks or some reagent and of course went to buy these at the pharmacist.
>
> And... so those experiments there which were involved... you know, in making pigments and so on. I started doing biochemistry shortly after that, which was extracting pigments from leaves and petals and so on, and actually discovering that anthocyanin pigments actually responded to pH and, needless to say, that was not an original discovery.

---

## 9. Never more than top six in high school

> In the meantime, I had progressed through school and as... we did not have much choice; we would always pursue a standard curriculum, and the subjects that we did was English, Afrikaans – which was the other language there – Latin, general science, history and mathematics. And that was the standard education if you were going on to more important things. If you weren't going to go to university, then of course you did commercial arithmetic instead of Latin; that was... sometimes was called... I think in my day it was still called bookkeeping but later they called it commercial arithmetic – it just sounded better.
>
> And I think that during my period in high school, I wasn't... I wasn't the sort of top of the class student. I was good, I always got into the first six, but people never pointed to me and said, 'He's going to be the... the winner'. And so I was quite... this... and of course I... when I passed my exams I did get a first class, but I didn't get any distinctions, for example.
>
> Yes, and all the people actually that were thought to be the real winners, who got four distinctions in matric, went on later to a life of total intellectual obscurity and so I think that led me always to the conclusion that even if a student comes to me with a first class degree, he has to prove to me he could have got a second class degree if he'd tried. Because I think that kind of book learning and giving it back in examinations was not my forte.
>
> I think that what... because already I think I'd started to ask questions beyond this, especially in science, I realised that what I was being taught in chemistry and physics and so on was just the... was just what was in the book and what you needed to do to... to pass an examination.
>
> The teachers were not very good, and of course this was at a... you know, in a provincial place in a provincial country in a small school, but, you know, one learnt just the basic elementary paths of chemistry. Mathematics did not take you as far as calculus; it took you as far as the solution of quadratic equations.

## 10. Beaten, bullied and strangled

> School teachers... the... the ones I remember positively is, first of all, Mrs McCartney – the owner of this kindergarten. I remember her. I remember my teacher Miss Stein, from when I first went to the public school, standard... when I was in standard II and for the rest of them... I mean, I have memories of them as being just a completely bunch of cruel... there was a... they were really awful people in my high school who were...
>
> For example they... the boys had... there was a man called Mr Cooij *[sic]*, who said we all had to wear ties – I think from this period stems my total dislike of ties – and if you came to his class without a tie, then what he would do is he would take the... the cords from the skylights, the fan lights, the windows and he would tie this around your neck in such a way that your feet were about a quarter of an inch off the ground, so you either strangled or stood on tiptoe all through the class, so every boy who didn't get a tie was strung up there. So, you know, such things of... like cruelty were pretty standard.
>
> I remember my English teacher who didn't like the way I recited the only poetry that I remembered, which was from King Lear, and is this wonderful speech where Edmund decries the fact that he's a bastard and it's full of words like base, vile, bastard, bastard, which of course was wonderful to enunciate in public and... with the correct tone of voice, and all the boys that crossed his... that crossed him, we would have to crawl into the class and stand – I mean, it's just ridiculous – and be like dogs there, kneel by our chairs until we got permission to sit there. So school wasn't a very stimulating environment and one just...

*[Q] Were you beaten?*

> Yes, we were; we were beaten. We were extremely bullied as well. It was a school with... and all schools there were... and since I was small and two to three years younger than everybody else, I simply grew up to be a professional coward; it's the only thing... that is, I would agree to everything not to get bullied. So, you know... so that is... that is also something that helps you to withdraw and then have fantasies how you can get your revenge on all of these people, but that was the thing... so, in a way, going to university was a tremendous liberation.

---

## 11. Self motivation and independent learning

> Well, of course I had decided that I wanted to be a scientist.

*[Q] Why?*

> Because I thought that it was something that you could actually do, and I should have said that of course the thing that turned me onto biology was the book *The Science of Life* by Wells... Huxley and Wells, I think it is... just G P Wells. And this book, of which I still have the copy, which I have to confess I stole from the public library and told them I lost it because I couldn't get a copy of it at the time, and so I paid the fine which may be... may have been two shillings in those days – that's a lot of money – and that is the book that really turned me on to biology.
>
> Because of course the biology at school, that... the things we learnt were quite simple. You know, they were about beans and how beans grew and so on, and I was always very interested in the experimental part of it. And I had realised in this way that you didn't actually have to ask people to do things; you could just go and do them. If you can get hold of a book that told you... introduced you to how to do it, you could just go and do it.
>
> So that is something I think that I have kept with me all my life because I've never learnt anything from going to courses. If I want to learn a new subject, I get a book and I start doing it. And it's advice I've always gived... I mean, when I got interested in computing in the early '60s, I started by learning an assembly language and actually programming a computer because there's... and I think in today's environment where nobody can learn anything unless they go to a course, or do this in a formal sense, I just never had that since there was no one really to teach me, and so I had cultivated – not cultivated, it had just come, probably out of necessity combined with inclination – just the idea that knowledge is out there; it's available. If you can't buy the book you can always go to the public library and steal it if necessary. So, I think that that is... and I think that's one of the most important things, to become a scientist.

*[Q] Sydney, it seems you were totally self-motivated. There were no friends, no teachers, no parents, nothing.*

> Yes, I mean, you know, I'd fortunately grown up in a culture where learning was quite important. The... the old... the Jewish immigrants into South Africa had come with the old Jewish culture that learning was important and of course if one could divert this learning to become a surgeon or a lawyer that was even better. My mother always said you should never marry a girl because... for her money but it's just as easy to fall in love with a rich girl as it is with a poor girl. So, I mean, there was that kind of culture which never said, 'This is nonsense', and so there was no stopping. School I think was just... if anybody had been through that, that was the thing, so I think you can become totally self-motivated because the world is out there and it's just available.

---

## 12. Humans' interest in science

> I think I had what most small boys have – and probably girls as well – which is just an interest in nature. In fact I've noticed in my own children that they always begin with this interest in nature, of seeds, of having animals swim around and looking down things at magnifying glasses. And then I think it is the formal teaching that destroys this. So if you just take as much of the formal teaching as is necessary to pass examinations, you needn't have this exploratory urge and I think that's one of the things that... that I think is... is science... and of course the fact that there is a way of actually asking and answering questions about nature.
>
> Well, the Wells book covers everything that was known about biology and so there was the whole thing about physiology, about how things worked, and how things worked seemed to me to be very important. I mean you know, I'm not trying... I'm trying not to add hindsight to all of this but just the fascination of knowledge in itself – that people had actually discovered, you know, that there were pigments involved in photosynthesis and this whole ability to, you know, draw the veil apart from nature. So I thought that that was something... that is what drove me. Now...
>
> Physics less so. It was this strange... it was biology which I... I thought was, you know, very important and it was just that attraction. I haven't been a good mathematician, I don't think I've been clever enough to be a mathematician. I found that physics, as it was taught to us, had got away from nature – it was all about pendulums and things like that – whereas biology was still there, and so that was the... that was the interest.

## 13. Going to Johannesburg University to study medicine

> Well, I had completed school at the age of... just at the end of my fourteenth year, and of course the war was on now so this was 19...

*[Q] What year was this?*

> I finished school in 1941, so in 1942 I went to university. Now, I didn't study science at university; what I did was I studied medicine, and the reason I did this was that I could get a bursary to go and study medicine and so on – because my parents would never have been able to afford it. So I got a bursary – it was £60 a year – from the Germiston town council; I won it in a competition.

*[Q] What was the competition?*

> It was just your exam results and interview and so on, and I got a bursary to go and study medicine. That, of course, paid my fees which were £60 a year, and I wasn't really interested in medicine but that's all there were bursaries for. And so the... this enabled me of course to go to university, but because there was no... my parents couldn't afford for me to go and live in Johannesburg or do that; I commuted every day from Germiston and that meant getting up... because classes started there at about eight o'clock in the morning, 8.30, so it meant getting up at about a quarter to six, cycling to the station which was about two and a half miles – which was quite hard on those cold winter mornings – catching the... the train, getting into the Johannesburg station and then walking to the university and doing this again at night and bringing sandwiches for lunch.
>
> So that actually... one lived at home, one didn't eat... I never ate in a cafe until... for quite a time, but always brought my lunch from home and then went back at home, you know, in the evening, catching the quarter past five train, and going out there, and getting my bicycle, and going back again.

## 14. Minyan Man

> I had also- I had got a sideline at that stage which allowed me to earn a sixpence a day and that was to be a- what is called a Minyan Man. What happens is that in order to say prayers, you must have ten adults there and of course you reach this adulthood at the age of thirteen. And so when I had undergone my Bar Mitzvah, I was then - because I was one of the poor people in the town - I was offered this job which meant coming every morning to the synagogue - which was actually on the way to the station, so you could just do it on the thing - and being present for people to come and say the Kaddish actually, the prayers for the dead, which they had to do on the anniversary and for which they needed ten people.
>
> And- so I spent quite a lot of time also, being the, the tenth man at prayers for the dead and I must say that I now don't go to funerals, it's one of my- I can't explain it but I just seem- I had enough of funerals for about four years of my life, of having to attend them and so on - as a professional mourner essentially - that now I don't go to funerals. I think I won't avoid being able to go to my own one but certainly not as a tenth man. However, so that was a- that paid sixpence a session, so you could earn a little bit more than that.

## 15. Science at university: Weinstein, Roux and Karnovsky

> At the university, that is where I met one of the most- I met a very interesting person who really taught me a lot in science. He was called Weinstein. He was a lecturer in the botany department. He had come as a refugee to Johannesburg - I don't even think he had a lectureship - but he was- but he taught there. The other person I came in contact with was a very great man called Edward Roux and it was Edward Roux who taught me botany, but what impressed-

*[Q] But what were you doing, doing botany in medicine - sorry Sydney?*

> The first year of medicine, you do Botany, Zoology, Chemistry and Physics, right, and so it's a pretty good scientific education. And the thing that I can remember that stands out most, was I used to spend, go after all the classes had finished to the labs in the Botany department and help Mr Weinstein every now and then and he showed me Chromatography. He showed me what I think was the first thing, it was all done on Kieselguhr and it was the separation of Carotenoid Pigments, just by absorption on to this, and that I just recalled as being tremendously impressive.
>
> As you may know, I mean we did a lot of laboratory work there; physics, chemistry. My teacher in chemistry, my lecturer in chemistry, was a man called Karnovsky, who later went on to Harvard and whose younger brother actually, Manfred, was with me, was someone I taught- Morris. Morris, Morris- Manfred was the older brother. Manfred had taught me, started to teach me chemistry there, he had come back there. I- he- I once criticised him. He asked me a question and I told him he didn't know what he was talking about and so, we still recall, he threw me out of the chemistry lecture- lecture theatre there because I argued with him. Actually, I was right.
>
> However, that really- there I started to really learn biology systematically and chemistry and physics and of course that- and of course going to university and not participating in university life in any sense because I would- I was a commuter and would go out, back each day, each night and so on. Being in South Africa, I was quite a good rugby player, and so I played a little bit of rugby in my first year, but I gave it up and-

*[Q] Sydney, if I could just come back to Roux and Weinstein. I mean, you said Roux was a very great man from your past. I mean these were very important influences, Weinstein and Roux?*

> Yes, well, I think Weinstein I just have, but Roux was- was- taught botany as a, as a living subject. I mean, it made me very interested, I think all the other- I mean zoology was deathly. We dissected a- we dissected a dogfish, you know, and one had to learn, start to learn almost by rote all of these things- there was very little functional thing. But it seemed to me that Roux had communicated, you know, what now would be called plant physiology. That was his interest at the time.

*[Q] Was any genetics there?*

> There was no genetics, in fact we didn't get taught genetics and I'll tell you how I got to genetics later on.

---

## 16. Edward Roux

> Well, Eddie I first came across as a scientist, but later I came across as a man and the author of I think the most moving book about South Africa, called *"Time Longer Than Rope"*. Because, Eddie of course was a left-wing activist all his life and his history, which I thought was tragic then, is even more tragic considering what has become of the world.
>
> Because Eddie was a communist, an early communist, dumped by the Komintern Agreement at the time, so he was branded as a Trotskyite, worked with the African movement as an independent until the time after the war, when he was still as great, and wrote this famous book about the history of African political movements and sort of gave me the- I mean I think it was really on knowing more about him and what he, and what he stood for, that led me to my reluctance to join any organisation and I never was a member of any organisation in the sense that people were members of political parties or political movements, because I've always felt you compromise if you join an organisation.
>
> And even now, when people ask me to sign petitions, I'm very reluctant because I just want to know who the other people in here and are they people I'd want to be associated with and I think that- so Eddie was, I think, a fantastic person as a scientist and as a man, and *"Time Longer Than Rope"* should be read by everybody, especially now, especially now.

## 17. My sad story of Harold Daitz

> Harold Daitz was a great influence on my life and in fact I found someone who had an understanding- this was someone who really taught me about the importance of asking questions in science and I spent hours, and this also came my love of just sitting around in the lab till all hours of the night, just talking. And of course it's something that my mother never understood, don't think my wife has still understood saying well, you know- why have you come home at four o'clock in the morning? And the thing is, well, you can't say- well we got talking, you know, and it just went on.
>
> And so, this is just something that was important. He went to England about a year before I did, he went to Oxford - Oxford I'll come back to that in a moment - and of course, when I came to England, and I came to Oxford, I went straight to his flat to see him to be greeted by his wife, that's Edna Rutowitz as she was, Edna O'Shaughnessy as she is now and to be told that he had died of a heart attack, the week before- I hadn't known.
>
> So, that I thought was- because one had all sorts of, you know, ideas about how great it would be to be doing science together.

*[Q] So he was in a way the first person you really spoke science to, was he?*

> He was the first person who spoke science, he was interested in neuroanatomy. Of course neuroanatomy and neurobiology are of course very interesting and very old interests of mine, and because of the influence of this whole school of people doing neuroanatomy in Johannesburg.

---

## 18. Joseph Gillman

> But I think the most significant person in many ways, and certainly the person about whom all the people that came under his influence never stopped talking about, and that was Joe Gilman. And Joe was then the Senior Lecturer in Histology and someone who exerted a great intellectual influence on a wide number of people and it was partly his interest, his interest in theoretical issues in science, I mean we used to spend hours and hours and hours discussing the difference between evocation and induction, Embryological Induction.
>
> But Joe started something that was very interesting. He had a brother called Teddy Gilman who actually came to England to Cambridge some years ago, many years ago and Joe and I started to read *"Biochemistry and Morphogenesis"*. We read it at lunchtime, that is, it was one of the things. I brought sandwiches and sat down there and read from this book-

*[Q] Aloud?*

> Yes, yes. That is, three or four pages used to be read at each lunch-time and discussed, it's very talmudic, but nonetheless that's the way I read *"Biochemistry and Morphogenesis"*.

*[Q] But I'd like to interrupt. But he was the senior lecturer and you were just a student.*

> I was just the student - I was an Honours student when all of this started - but I think Joe really wanted to be a theoretician, and of course, I think in retrospect Joe would want you to agree with the way he thought about it, and of course that was one of his failings, and although he was a great stimulus of people, there was this incredible love hate relationship. People couldn't stand to be with him.
>
> When Joe- I remember when Joe went to Accra - he left Johannesburg and went to Accra - we had just come to London, this was in the fifties, he left just after Sharpville. We used to say- any day and N'Kruma is going to arrive in London and say please let me in, and people were saying- why do you want to be here? He said- it's this guy Gilman, I can't stand him any longer, I've just got to get out.
>
> But that is the thing, and I still see friends of mine who went through this period, like Ben Kaminer who just, you know go back to those days and another- and so, Joe I think was a great formative influence. I think he was too much of a person who- he certainly was not an experimentalist in the sense that I had become one, you know, he was a great describer, his thesis was on the Golgi Apparatus and he had done- I mean there were all kinds of strange connections.
>
> For example, he started nutritional work. One of my jobs was actually to make amino acids, because of course we were doing nutrition on rats there, but we couldn't - it was during the war - we couldn't make amino acids. So, I actually manufactured Cysteine and Tryptophan by the classic methods. Cysteine from a barber, from the barber's shop, from human hair. There is a classical description of how to make Cysteine, and actually, Tryptophan from milk and Gowland Hopkins is, is someone who had given all those descriptions, so I had learnt to make amino acids and so on.

## 19. Seymour Papert

> Now a very important person in my South African life is someone- that is **Seymour Papert**. Seymour was someone about my age, contemporary of mine, and Seymour was a brilliant, is still a brilliant mathematician and in fact, much later in the course, he was also very interested in politics and philosophy and it was much later, while I was a medical student, that I got to know him very well and in fact, he taught me mathematics and I taught him physiology. Thank God it wasn't the other way around.
>
> And he is someone who I think got me interested in the whole idea of mathematical theories and ultimately in computers and things like this because he went off to MIT where he worked with Marvin Minsky on the whole field of Artificial Intelligence and so on. So he was a very good friend and a very important one and also, because of the fringe left-wing politics that we were associated together.

## 20. The beginning of my interest in biochemistry

> In my second year I went up to the medical school where I did Anatomy and Physiology, and that was the beginnings really of, of a new kind of interest, because physiology, I just found totally remarkable. Actually, what I found interesting there was, what is now called biochemistry and-

*[Q] And was there biochemistry as such?*

> It was taught as part of physiology. We did a little bit of biochemistry as it was called, which were largely sort of tests for- of urine for glucose. There was a kind of standard thing which every medical student went to. I have to say that the teaching in medicine in South Africa was based on the Scots system, and they aimed to produce someone who could leave the medical school and do everything in medicine and so we had a lot of courses there which I'll come to in a moment.
>
> But there were two people, there were a number of people, when I came to do second year medicine, that I found very, very stimulating. One was Joe Gilman, and since he's played quite a big role in mine and other people's lives, he needs something of his own, but I'll come back to that if you- we can leave that.
>
> So- but the one thing that I think you will- that I learnt during this which I found, is that this is the first time I came to realise my teachers knew nothing. And this had come because I discovered a book which is up there on the shelf- no, no- and which is called *"Perspectives in Biochemistry"*.

---

## 21. Realising my lecturers knew nothing

> What had happened was we had lectures on where bile pigments came from. And I had come to the conclusion that the lecturer must be wrong. And they'd given us an idea about the origin of bile pigments, that they were by biosynthesis and so on and of course this is from the degradation of... of haemoglobin and... but they had given us a theory of how these arose, which was archaic, and I had on first principles, come to the conclusion that the lecturer was wrong.

*[Q] What was the first principles?*

> Just the chemistry of the porphyrin nucleus and what had happened was I discovered in this book an article, by a man called Rudolph Lemberg – in this book – who actually worked on how the bile pigments came about. And what amazed me is that "my lecturers had never heard of him, but there he was, very important figure" and this book was in the... the library.
>
> Of course, that was that realisation but this book is... was full of the most remarkable set of papers that I had ever read. My textbook of physiology at the time was *Starling's Textbook of [Human] Physiology* and of course I found physiology fascinating and... the whole lot of things there. But in the terms of biochemistry, it is this book that opened my eyes to the great richness that could come from the molecular explanation of living processes.
>
> And I think it is then, in about 1943, that I had realised that you've got to do chemistry and biology, and there's got to be a science that studies the function of cells and which... and which... I didn't know what it was at the time, but which brings together life and chemistry in some strong sense.
>
> There are interesting articles there. For example, there's a very interesting article by... on... by Scott Moncrieff on the genetics of colour pigmentation in plants, which sort of closed the cycle on my old extracts of the leaves and the petals and so on, and I suddenly realised they knew all about this. But this was the beginnings of these ideas of biochemical genetics. Of course, they had older... but the beginnings of the ideas in my mind and the... and the first beginning realisation about genes, which of course I... I didn't know about at all, because we had no teaching in the subject.

*[Q] Did you discuss any of these ideas with anybody?*

> Well, I tried to discuss it with my teachers but, in fact, this was just impossible; there was no communication there.

---

## 22. What we learnt at medical school

> My colleagues were just a bunch of guys wanting to be doctors. In fact, during my second year anatomy... in those days we actually spent a whole year doing human dissection. There's none of this present style where you look it up in a book or a database; we actually dissected, and we actually had to know everything in the human body, because that is the way you did anatomy in the old days. There's a very remarkable professor of anatomy there, called **Raymond Dart**, who I'll come back to again.
>
> And... and also... so, now at the time this was an English language university – the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg – there were no Afrikaans speaking universities where people could do medicine or dentistry at that time, and so there were a lot of Afrikaaners came to this... came to do medicine here. And because of the nature of South African politics at the time, people were very careful as to who they put at a... at a dissection table. There were six of us, three on each side of the body when we changed places at this... and so I was assigned to a table with five Afrikaaners, because of my name; they had thought from my name I must be an Afrikaaner.
>
> One of the people I did keep up with, he later became a professor of dentistry in South Africa, a man called Dreyer. However, there I was, and they refused to speak English, so I learnt Afrikaans. I became fully bilingual. In fact, it stood me in great stead, because I could always get a booking on a railway train just by asking for it in Afrikaans. I became fully bilingual because we just spoke Afrikaans. Of course, I could speak quite a bit of it because I had played at school with Afrikaans... Afrikaaners and so on, but here I became fully bilingual. And in fact, I do have an accent which is still... and in my English accent, is still rather Afrikaans accent – not the usual kind of Jo'burg accent.
>
> So I had... I learnt anatomy, and I'd been to lectures during my course on histology because we had to do the whole of histology. And there was a remarkable man there called Joe Gillman who really believed in science and so on, and so I found this field of being able to look down a microscope, and actually see cells, completely fascinating.
>
> Now, when I think back of what we had to do in 40 weeks... because medical students worked hard. We had 40 weeks; it was eight o'clock... 8.00am to 5.00pm every day, many laboratory sessions. We had to learn anthropology, we had to learn palaeontology, a little bit of it, we had to learn the whole of histology, neurology, human embryology and be willing to answer questions on it, plus the whole of physiology. And all to be accomplished within one year.

---

## 23. Doing an additional BSc year

> Now, during the course of this year, it had become realised that if I just went on and did my six years medicine, I would finish medicine under the age of 21 and that I couldn't become registered at that time – you had to be over 21 to become a registered doctor. And so therefore I would have to spend a year doing something else.
>
> And one of the things that was available, which fitted in very nicely with everything, was a... a BSc degree. And of course the people who paid my bursary realised that I would have to do this in order... so they gave me an extra year. And I therefore deviated at the end of the second year to do a BSc in physiology and anatomy.
>
> And a small group of people did this each year... into this class, and one suddenly realised that now one was entering in... into science, because there were in that – especially in the histology department – a number of people who had not only done a BSc degree, but had done an Honours degree and a Masters degree and that they began to run the BSc class, and in this department people were actually doing research.
>
> And one of my teachers there was a remarkable man called Harold Daitz, who died quite young in... later on. Another man was a man called Mike Wright, who was about a year ahead of me, and who had gone on to do neuroanatomy. And so in that year, one really began to do research. That is, we all were put in a room and we were... all had a... I think there were about 11 of us.
>
> And two of my colleagues I still keep in touch with from that time; I saw one recently who had just retired as professor of anaesthesiology in University of... at Washington University in Seattle – University of Washington in Seattle. And this was absolutely an amazing experience because on the anatomy side, we had lectures in palaeontology from Robert Broom, and I still have a copy of his... of a book he gave me.
>
> We did a whole series of sessions with people in the department and that we were taught about the physics and chemistry of dyes as a basis of staining of tissue. My teacher here was someone who remained a friend for life, who was Joel Mandelstam. He had... he was a chemist who had joined Joe Gillman's department to do research and tried to do biochemistry there.
>
> We did projects in embryology, in... involving three-dimensional reconstruction of embryos from serial sections, traced out with a Camera Lucida onto sheets of beeswax and the thing stacked, and this technology I learnt. I also did a project in neuroanatomy and did a reconstruction of part of a galago brain, and it was absolutely the... a tremendous experience.
>
> On the physiology part we started to do some more biochemistry. Now one thing we could do was take up some project of our own... and from my reading in various books, I had become tremendously impressed by trying to work on cell physiology... on enzymology. And one of the things that was done in those days, was to measure oxygen uptake – that was the only way you could study oxidation and reduction pathways. You had manometers and you would add these enzymes and the things, and you would shake them, and you would watch to see the changes in pressure.
>
> And – there were two kinds – there was a thing called a Warburg manometer, and everybody worked with these, and of course there wasn't such a thing available, so I decided I'd build one, and I sat down and I first had to learn how to blow glass and grind tabs. So I actually did build a Warburg manometer and measure the oxygen uptake of tissues and this led me to say, 'Now I know what I want to do; I want to become a cell physiologist'. And I had become interested then in trying to find out now how cells could work and how... and how this... how one could do... how one could penetrate this.

---

## 24. Joe Gillman's philosophy of science

> From the other side, and the two things led together, as you will see, I became very interested in... in looking at cells under microscopes and what could you learn from this, and so I'd become very excited by the ability to do histochemistry – cytochemistry as it was called – and I thought somehow between the system that you grind up and the system that you can actually look at, you had to have some synthesis.
>
> Now of course, in those days, no one knew much about anything and so the questions that one always debated were: can you really find out about a living cell by taking it apart? And this is a great philosophical problem, and of course what one had come to realise, because of other things there, that Joe was a Marxist and so he believed in things...

*[Q] This is Joe Gillman?*

> Joe Gillman. So he believed in things called dialectical synthesis, which I never understood... but anyway, is that you learn nothing from the mechanical disintegration of this. Later I understood where all these ideas came from by actually reading Lenin's book *Materialism and Empirio-Criticism*.
>
> Now, you may say that how does one get to read all of this, and now I have to tell you that one of the great things we did is we did a third subject; we had to do, it was compulsory for everybody doing a BSc degree – that you had to do the history and philosophy of science... as a formal subject.

---

## 25. Getting into the philosophy of science

> One of the things that became very important in this course was that everyone had to complete a course of lectures and write an examination in the history and philosophy of science. The lectures were given by Brian Farrell, a logical positivist who later taught at Oxford.
>
> This aroused my interest in philosophy. We read works including Crowther's *"The Social Relations of Science"* and books on the history and philosophy of science, which introduced us to logical positivism. I became fascinated by people who had taken science and developed philosophy from it.
>
> From that year onwards, I spent considerable time reading philosophy. I read Moritz Schlick's work and physicists' perspectives on philosophy, particularly Max Born's book on causality in physics. This led me to quantum mechanics, and I read Einstein's popular books on the subject.
>
> We studied Aristotle and Plato as part of the formal curriculum, but what truly interested me was twentieth-century philosophy emerging from science. The political dimensions became embedded through Marxist influences. Meanwhile, I was becoming increasingly politically active regarding South Africa, all while trying to understand the twentieth century from this remote, provincial location during wartime.

## 26. Lab cocktails

> The next year, having deviated to do one year, the question is: do you go back to medicine? Most of my colleagues did, but I decided I was more interested in this, and so I would stay on and do an Honours degree. And so that's exactly what I did. Now of course my bursary was suspended, but I got a job in the department as a technician. That is, I was paid in lieu of fees, and I also was paid a small salary, and what I essentially did was make a whole set of teaching slides of the human body – histology, helping a technician.
>
> So I learnt how to embed human tissue, and, for that matter, animal tissue, but any tissue. I learnt how to section these. I learnt how to stain them and mount them, and so I became a... essentially histology technician and I used to go and work there in the department doing all of this.
>
> It is there also that I discovered the wonders of **Puccini's fluid**. Now, Puccini's fluid is nothing to do with the opera. Puccini's fluid was a preservative that was consisted of 70%... sorry, one part of 95% alcohol and one part of glycerine, and I had made this up and I was, I think, preserving some tissue in it or clearing it or something... I decided to have a taste of this stuff.
>
> And of course glycerine is exactly what you need to cut the taste, the bite of the alcohol and Puccini's fluid, which after having a taste, I... this was a Saturday afternoon – I woke up on the floor of the laboratory Sunday morning, still holding this 100cc measuring cylinder – I'd taken much more than a taste of it.
>
> But it actually is the best way to make lab cocktails. And a very good formula is absolute ethanol, and one should not use 100% actually because that has been cleaned by cold distillation with benzene, so it's pretty poisonous. 95% is good enough and one part of that, one part of glycerol and one part of orange juice or something like this, makes something that is so smooth, so tasteless and so effective that it's the best thing you can do, and so Puccini's fluid I think has a lot to recommend it.
>
> Actually, this discovery of the cutting edge of glycols was, as you know, used fairly recently when people were adding ethylene glycol to wine to give it that sort of mature taste. Except ethylene glycol is poisonous – it's... it's what you put in your radiators. You know, there was a scandal some time ago that they were poisoning the wine. But glycerine I can tell you is a natural compound and is perfectly safe. However... but that's a little sideline, and... but I learnt to do all of this and there I really started to do some... I really started on doing research.

## 27. My first ever research paper

*[Q] You did do a research project in your BSc, with the manometer.*

> Yes, I did that, I built the machine and I also did some other things. I started to do fluorescence microscopy, which we had then; in fact, wrote a paper on this work, together with Joe Gillman and Teddy Gillman.

*[Q] Your first paper?*

> I think it's my first paper.

*[Q] What was the paper about?*

> The paper was on porphyrin fluorescence in the liver of pellagra, and I went on to study... I've got a copy of that somewhere, and...

*[Q] But that must have been quite exciting.*

> It was very exciting, you see, and actually for me to realise... you see the porphyrins were connected with Rudolph Lemberg – that's when I learnt all about porphyrins.

---

## 28. Why I love pigments

*[Q] You always liked pigments.*

> I love pigments, I love colour...

*[Q] Why do you love pigments? I mean, given that...*

> Because you can see them, you see, and that's why I think sugar, sugar biochemistry and all this colourless biochemistry is really colourless. But pigments are amazing, and I've been fascinated by dyes, and in fact the whole idea of interpreting what you can stain, I really thought this was going to be the powerful way to... to study biology. Now of course during the... so sorry.

*[Q] Now, I want to come back... sorry, we need to understand how was it... I mean, here you were in Honours class, you'd never been with a group of people interested in science at all, and suddenly you're publishing a paper with the Gillmans.*

> Well, I started to work with this and now, for the first time, we actually sat around and talked about science and scientific problems during my BSc year and of course... more and more intensively as I stayed on there and they had run... of course, the apprenticeship system is a very different form of teaching, and putting you onto a project, and so, for the first time, actually, there were other people interested in science, other people trying to solve problems and so this was the beginnings of a kind of lab interaction, and the whole sort of concept that you could go... you could discuss how to do things and so on. That started in that BSc degree.

*[Q] And you actually got a pay. But it's unusual also to get a pay.*

> Yes, so I started because I had those interests and there was this paper that was published, and in fact I published very quickly in my Honours year several papers which depended on these.

---

## 29. Archaeology and palaeontology

> Now, also at that time, another interest had emerged, which threatened effectively to become an alternative profession, but I stopped it. But I'll just tell you a little about it. Raymond Dart had been made famous throughout the world for the discovery of Australopithecus. This was a skull... a fossil skull of what was supposed to be the missing link, and nothing much had... more had been done on that and this was being questioned and so on.
>
> And then Robert Broom had found these skulls... although Robert Broom was well known for all his work on reptile palaeontology, but he had started to excavate caves just outside a town called Krugersdorp, called Sterkfontein and Kromdraai. And in our science year we... we decided we would go on expedition to Sterkfontein and... in order to go and try... we went with Broom and, in fact, that was the beginning of mounting more and more expeditions to try and do excavations and so on.
>
> So I got led through this to a very deep interest in archaeology and palaeontology and that of course did echo something about one's interest in nature again, and here it had come back the other way and of course this is... this had brought me directly in... into contact with, you know, problems of evolution in this way.
>
> So I know that this sounds as if a lot of things were being done at the same time, but that is what it was like. So, you know, Saturday afternoon... or we would go for the weekend to Sterkfontein; we would go and dig in the caves or sort rubble all day; we'd play poker all night. We played poker, which depended on using sheets of toilet paper – scrip – and in fact I... there was this hysterical evening. You know, there was the Sterkfontein skull that everybody knew about, and what happened is at 2.00am one morning, I got what I called the Sterkfontein hand, and this was a royal flush. It's the first and only time I got it – I cleaned them out of their toilet paper scrip, but that's the only thing I ever discovered from this excavation, was the Sterkfontein hand, which was a royal flush in hearts. That I'll never forget. In fact, we woke everybody up at 2.00am to show this great discovery of the Sterkfontein hand, but there you are, so...
>
> And then you back to the lab on Monday, you know, do a little bit of neuroanatomy and on Wednesday, do something else. So it was a very sort of, you know, life in which everything was on the go. And one had developed a little coterie of people who were not just interested in, you know, just going to university and qualifying and so on.

---

## 30. Forming a territorial army

> I should also say that I also spent... I was also in the army at this time. In fact, what had happened was, as part of the war effort, the university students and the medical students had formed something that was a... like the territorial army – that is, a kind of weekend army – as part of this, and in fact there was the... the whole of the Johannesburg Medical School had formed a field ambulance. I think it was called the **25th Field Ambulance**, and in fact there were two full-time soldiers that actually occupied offices in the medical school, and the head of the ambulance was Professor Dart, who had the rank of colonel and then all the other lecturers in the medical school had different ranks.
>
> In fact, a very old friend of mine, John Robinson, who was a medical student a little bit ahead of me; he was very famous as the man who broke down when we went on our annual three week camp and was sent home in... in tears.

---

## 31. The Army camps

> So in the army – the 25th Field Ambulance – we would go to camp on weekends. That is, we would collect trucks in Johannesburg at two o'clock on... and meet at two o'clock on Saturday afternoon, go out to one of the army camps, and then of course come back on Sunday evening and that during the holidays, which was during July – it was still very cold, especially at the height of Johannesburg – we would go for a two to three week camp.
>
> And one of the camps we went to was out in the bush so we could spend a bit of time doing some archaeology on the side and here we would do exercises and manoeuvres and actually bring people in. I rose to the rank of corporal actually, but I think I was too young to be promoted any further than that, and I served my time and I learnt how to drive.
>
> And I also became a cook with a man called Cecil Luck, whom was a lecturer in the physiology department – a very interesting man who went out to Uganda to teach there and of course returned to South Africa when that changed the way it did. But he was a physiologist and he was in fact in charge of the cooking, and of course I should hesitate to say that that's where I learnt how to cook – possibly that's where I learnt how not to cook – but that is just one the things that one learnt, and it also...
>
> And all of this, having grown up in a small town which had... in which the big scene... the big feature were all these mine dumps; that is the dumps of all the sand and clay that had come from extracting gold. These yellow mine dumps, flat, completely artificial. The only place one had ever seen was Germiston Lake, which was in fact the remnants of an old mine. The whole idea of getting right out into... into the bush was amazing. I mean that already happened in going out to Sterkfontein and it happened more and more with the army camps. And then, of course, later on as we went on more and more archaeological expeditions... so this opened up this whole incredible country, and coming from a small, urban thing where the... everything... there was no nature, no... nothing to see, this was one of the most incredible eye-openers of the time.

---

## 32. Geology: expedition with Alexander du Toit

> I then had developed this... this very great interest in archaeology and palaeontology, and so going out on these camps had become a regular thing, and in fact I went... in 1947, I went on an expedition with a man called Bosazzar and another man called Ray Adie, both of whom were geologists. We went on an expedition to the Kalahari Desert and it was... and I had been there before to parts of this, but actually I wrote a scientific paper on this... on the whole idea that there were these desert cycles in Africa which... which were most important for how the whole development of this thing, and that these were correlated, basically, with the cycles – the glacial cycles that were better known in the north...

*[Q] So you learnt geology too?*

> Yes, I learnt geology. In fact I learnt quite a lot of geology. In fact, I'd become quite an expert on it and did later... and in 1947 or '48, I can't remember, when a big expedition came out from the University of California who wanted to see all the sights, I went with them and I went essentially as a guide, and that's where I met – because they'd asked him to go – **Alex du Toit**. Alex du Toit, as it would be called in French, but du Toit as we called it, was one of the most remarkable people. He is the... one of the great inventors of Gondwanaland, he's... with Wegener, and his book, *The Geology of South Africa*, of which I have a copy, is in fact the whole of the idea of the wandering continents, and he had come to the conclusion of geology alone that Africa and South America were once joined up.
>
> Now, he had a most remarkable life. He was already quite an old man when I met him, and he had gone out to survey the Kalahari Desert – which is where we went – as a young man for the geological survey in about 1890. In fact, the geological maps were the ones he made. And he turned up there dressed like, I would say, a Dutch Reform Church preacher. He was dressed in a black suit with a waistcoat and a tie and a hat. Now, all the Americans had come out you know, in expedition outfits with... with bush hats with little leopard skin rings. I had come out in my thing, which was shorts and boots and a shirt and a hat because we wore this, but du Toit had come there dressed in this beautiful suit.
>
> And I remember that one wonderful thing that happened on this trip was we were going along a road in the Kalahari Desert, in the middle of nowhere, and the people were asking about water divination, so he said he believes in it. So they said, 'You, a scientist; you believe in water divination?' He says, 'Yes'. He says, 'Just stop the car here'. He says, 'I'll show it to you, prove it to you'. So stop the car apparently in the middle of nowhere, and he gets out of the car and he cuts a branch, and he goes about... does this sort of tremendous amount of formality and ritual, and then he walks along the road and the thing bends. And he says, 'Well', he says, 'this means there must be water somewhere, so there should be a fault line somewhere here, and if we just go off down here, let's go and look for it'. And sure enough, we go down there and there's this thing, which... there's a little... little spring there – it had dried up, but you could see there had been a spring there. So all these Americans were amazingly impressed by this.
>
> And when we were going back, he started to tell me in Afrikaans how he came through here as a young man in about 1890 on an ox wagon doing... making the geological survey of this region and that he had found the spring here and that he recognised the topography of the land while we were talking. So I found this to be very amazing thing. However, he had a... this gives one an eye for country. It gives one an eye that one can look at a... at... at the topography and see its history in it. And of course, as you may imagine, this was threatening to become another profession and so I decided to give it up.
>
> And a colleague of mine who was one year behind me, Philip Tobias, he decided that he would continue it and I've always enjoyed it as a hobby; I've always enjoyed... I've just enjoyed the idea that one can go out and look at a country and of course extract its history from it, and of course that's another interest of course I've had in astronomy.

## 33. "To Serve Man"

> Astronomy I'm a complete amateur. I got interested in this... of course, if you live in the southern hemisphere you can't... you can't but be interested in the sky, and of course I would say that most of my interest in the stars was as a... an assiduous reader of science fiction. I became... from about the age of eight – seven or eight – I became a reader of science fiction and this had come about... if I can go back to there...
>
> One of my mother's brothers was... was rather wealthy; that is, he had done well. He had a shop in Fordsburg where he sold first bicycles and then... and then radios, and he had done very well, Uncle Harry, and was not married. And I used to go and visit him and one of the things that there was in the street in Fordsburg was... Fordsburg was a suburb of... of Johannesburg, next to an equally depressed area called Mayfair, surprisingly enough, just out on the western suburbs and was inhabited by a lot of people, mostly poor whites then, who had come in as being displaced from the land, had come into the city, mostly Afrikaaners who had come in as a result of the agricultural depression in the thirties. And so they... they were the clientele there, and my uncle would always take me for lunch to the Fordsburg Hotel – which is where he had his lunch – where we'd have something that I think you can only get in South Africa called a mixed grill, and I actually knew someone who could eat three South African mixed grills and... and survive, but still.
>
> And then he would give me some money – half a crown, which was, well, amazing – and I would go to this second-hand bookstore where this person had past numbers of something called *Amazing Stories* which you could buy for about tuppence each. These were the pulp magazines – there were two of them which were the best; one was called *Amazing Stories*; other called *Astounding Stories*. They came from... they came from... America and I collected these and this is where I encountered, you know, all the great names – Robert Heinlein and so on.
>
> And I still have an enormous collection of science fiction. In fact, this stood me very well in later years, when Francis Crick wrote a paper on the idea of Pangenesis, namely that all life... Panspermia, I'm sorry – that all life had been brought here from outer space and the planet seeded. I told him that I'd read this somewhere before, and he said that was very interesting, could I give him the reference. I said, well, I can't remember the exact number, but it was *Amazing Stories*, either 1936 or 1937, I'm sure you could find... find it there; it's been published before and he should be careful, you know, not to be accused of plagiarism.
>
> However... but this again was, you know, an interesting... another way of looking at the world and of course in the early days it was the kind of small boy interest. But in later years I... I liked this a lot for what it explored about society and human nature, and I think that some of the inversions, the unexpected inversions... and I can remember two of these, because there's a sort of thinking that I liked... I liked the... I like the playing with words, and the one I think very, very well of is the one written by a man called... August Derleth *[sic]* I think his name is. The title of this article is *How to Serve Man* *[sic]*, and it says that earth is in a terrible state. These people come from outer space and they bring enormous benefits; they give humanity boxes which are endless supplies of energy and they just exude goodness – altruism. Of course, the... the teller of the story is a journalist who is deeply suspicious of all of this and all his friends say, 'No, no, no, these come from another planet; they're completely altruistic; there are no hidden motives', and what is then... they then say their slogan is *How To Serve Man* *[sic]* – that's what they've entitled it – and they have these courses that people get elected for and go and get taken to wonderful places where they get educated and so on, except what is very strange is that no one has ever met anybody who's come back from this.
>
> And of course, the investigation goes on when he discovers that what these people are really interested in is cooking and eating, and *How to Serve Man* *[sic]* is in fact not only the title of the most important book in their culture but it's a recipe book, and of course that's the end of the story.
>
> So I think this kind of duality has always appealed to me and there are lots of other cases of it and... and I think their experiments with societies, some of them are, I think, brilliant. *The Space Merchants* I think is a brilliant parody of America; of the future. The only thing in this is, you know, it's come true basically – that's the disappointing thing.

## 34. Language and wordplay

*[Q] Your... your passion for words and language, I mean, which is the first time you've mentioned it; did you read novels and poetry?*

> Oh yes; I didn't read much poetry but I've always been a great devourer of books, indiscriminate of course, so I read everything that I can lay my hands on. I did not much enjoy the sort of formal text that we were given at school; in fact I have an... I have a total dislike for Sir Walter Scott, after being forced to read *Quentin Durward* for my matric – as far as I'm concerned, I never want to read another thing. However... but it is just the... the whole idea of... of this communication has been... has been an interest of mine for a very long time.

*[Q] The wordplay, Sydney?*

> The wordplay I think is part of... is part of the way one... one learns to think. I think wordplay is just alternative interpretations of the same thing, and I think that that's a lot of... a lot of science involves that: of... of taking... looking at the thing on the surface and see that there... there's more than one way of looking at it and see there's more than one way of extracting something from it.

*[Q] But did you get pleasure from this wordplay even when rather young or do you think it was something that came to you later?*

> Yes, well I think the... the idea of punning is... there's probably a gene for it in our family because my grandson is exactly like this. At quite a young age he is already inventing words and doing things like this. I mean, inventing words is a good one; for example, he has... he has an invention of a... a Jewish-Japanese restaurant, which is called **Sosumi** – an American Jewish-Japanese restaurant. So this is... the... the wordplay is part of the way one manipulates one's thinking, and so I think that's also part of it.

## 35. The Nadi reaction

> During my Honours year, I again expanded my interests into large parts of biology, because that's the one thing this... this enables one to do. But I had started to do things in... in cytochemistry, and, in fact, one of the interesting things was to do something which was called the **Nadi reaction**. Now, the Nadi reaction has, in recent years, come into favour as a measurement of the cytochrome oxidase system. But I can honestly say that I was the first person to discover that.
>
> It had been known as the Nadi reaction and it had measured some enzyme called... which was called indophenol oxidase, and what you did was you took these two components, diphenyl diamine, and you put it in and when you had this enzyme, it made this com... it made this blue dye, indophenol blue.
>
> And I did a set of experiments which actually proved that this was related to what had then been called... had then been called cytochrome oxidase. Because what I showed... it was mitochondria that gave you the Nadi reaction, all right? And... and I actually wrote a paper on this and published it as part of the annual meeting of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science in 1946, so it goes back a long way.

*[Q] It wasn't your first; that was one of your later papers?*

> Yeah, that was the second... my second paper, yes.

---

## 36. My MSc in working out the chromosome complement of Elephantulus

> After completing my Honours degree, I pursued a Master's degree, using the extra year to study genetics and chromosomes. I was profoundly influenced by Edmund Beecher Wilson's *"The Cell in Development and Heredity,"* particularly the passage stating that "The chromosomes are the bearers... the material bearers of heredity."
>
> Beginning with onion root specimens, I taught myself cytogenetics using two key texts: CD Darlington's *"Recent Advances in Cytogenetics"* (1937) and Darlington and La Cour's *"The Handling of Chromosomes."* I selected the **Elephantulus** – a small shrew native to South Africa – as my research subject.
>
> My Master of Science thesis, *"The Chromosome Complement of Elephantulus,"* represented pioneering cytogenetic work in South Africa. Though I initially reported an incorrect number (14 rather than 28), this research established the field locally. Philip Tobias subsequently studied the gerbil, further developing cytogenetics in the region. I characterized this work as "the first sort of connection of genes and cells," continuing my broader investigation into cellular mechanisms.

## 37. Microscopy

> There was at that time a rather remarkable person in the... in the histology department called Alf Oettli, and Alf Oettli was a microscopist, and he believed in dark field microscopy, because he had learned this from a very famous man called Adrianus Pijper. Now, Adrianus Pijper was a man who had seen flagellae of bacteria under dark field, and of course it was through Alf Oettli that I really learnt about microscopy as a subject.
>
> One of the things that you needed to do this was an intense source of illumination, and so what we built was... is... was a heliostat. This was a mirror which effectively was hooked to a clock so that it followed the sun and would pick up the sun and reflect it into the lab so that we had with this heliostat and in the days of... of brilliant sunshine, especially that you get during the winter in South Africa, this report... this gave us a remarkable set of... gave us a remarkable source of illumination.

## 38. Broad academic discussion as a student

> There were... at that time in Johannesburg, there were lots of people who had become great admirers of Ludwig Wittgenstein, and, in fact, many came to Cambridge; Duncan Linney was one of those people who had become... come to sit at the feet of Wittgenstein. And of course logical positivism was 'in' in those days, and we used to have many discussions in this field of which we'd come to the conclusion that the fundamental question in philosophy was: 'define define', which was always a good remark to be said after a long discussion; you could ask, 'Define define'.
>
> So there's all that kind of student turmoil, and of course, all of this spilled over into other things; I had very good friends who were highly interested in the arts, Stanley Glasser being one of them, and so music... in fact we actually made a film. All of us together: I wrote the script, my wife played the main part, it was produced by Stan, it was filmed by his brother, and I have to tell you that what we decided to film was a story from a Dylan Thomas book, which... which was *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*, one of his portrait... no, that's... that's... is that the book? Anyway, it was a Dylan Thomas book of stories, and of course we tried to recreate this Welsh town in Johannesburg.
>
> None of us had ever been abroad, and so from this description... I can't even remember the story, I just wrote the script and the movie was made... it was actually shown. Bill Coker, John Coker's younger brother, played the lead part. Music was composed for it, but... and when I saw it and when I first came... when I then came to England and saw Wales, I just... I just began to realise how wrong we'd got everything, because to try and transform that... however, it was just the picture of the times that you'd try your hand at anything, you see, so we did lots of these things as students; it was all very exciting.

## 39. Passing the time with medicine

> I then... I had a good friend called Tony Allison at the time, who was doing science with me, and Le Gros Clark, who was professor of anatomy at Oxford, came out to South Africa in 1946 to see the anatomical remains – the palaeontological remains. And at this stage, he invited me to go back to Oxford to the anatomy department there, where I could continue to do science, because you... you must remember that a little bit later, Harold Daitz went to Le Gros Clark. So there were those connections between Dart and Le Gros Clark and... he also invited Tony Alison.
>
> I went to see Raymond Dart and said, 'What shall I do?' And Dart was a very wise man. He was at this time the Dean of the medical school, a great anatomist of the old school, had come from London, had seen Owen and all those people there. So, he said, 'Look, it sounds to me what you're interested in would be called biochemistry, but there are no jobs for people in biochemistry unless they are in medical schools, so what I advise you to do is to go back and finish medicine, and then you can become a biochemist'. And I took a lot of advice from people and everybody said... well, yeah, they agreed; there would be a dead end; there's no future in science as science at that time, because I'm talking about 1947; and the best thing is go back and finish medicine.
>
> So I had four years to do. So I stayed on in the department doing research and sort of did medicine part-time and... and what I did was I went on working there and used to just polish off the course in the last six weeks of the year, so... because I just was totally uninterested. The first year of going back wasn't too bad because we did pathology and bacteriology and that was still science, I did very well then. But then we started clinical work, and I... I just wasn't suited to that. I didn't like... I didn't like the whole structure of the teaching hospital; that is, I felt very much that treating patients as things is the wrong thing and that since I thought it was very hard to be a scientist and not do this, then I preferred not to do it at all.
>
> So in fact, I think I'm the only person who's ever passed medicine who had never seen a patient until his examination because I never went, and in fact one of the great stories is that I failed my medicine because I was asked to smell this patient's breath, incorrectly diagnosed Maclean's toothpaste, where I should have diagnosed acetone, you see; so the visiting professor from... the examining professor from Cambridge passed me... failed me.

## 40. Being the best in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

> However, I got the top first-class in obstetrics and gynaecology, and that was simply because you had to go and do this in residence, and at the time there was... you had to go into residence in a maternity hospital, and at the time of course all the students were trying to get into the white maternity hospital, Florence Nightingale, and be in the professor's firm to further their careers, and I didn't care where they sent me, and so I got a hospital right at the bottom of the list.
>
> It was a hospital in Durban, it was a black hospital and it was just on the Congella docks, and the four medical students who were all the kind of... you know, the leftovers, had this hotel room in this hotel where... let me just put it this way: amoebic dysentery was the mildest disease you could catch there. The rest of the hotel, as far as I could work out was taken up by ladies who entertained the sailors from the ship, and we had a telephone that connected us to the black hospital.
>
> There was nothing else to do except learn how to deliver babies and study obstetrics. So, since I had to do it, I managed to do it extremely well, and I learnt a lot about life that way and... being stuck out there. So that's part of the thing.

---

## 41. Scientific work undertaken during medical school

> But I went back... after this, I did another six months and finally passed medicine, but I had done research all along and published, in fact one of my papers that I published during this time involved getting down and synthesising a lot of dyes because I... I was interested in mitochondria and thought that the whole supravital staining of mitochondria was due to the oxidising enzymes there and the redox potential and so on. And so I synthesised a lot of dyes in the series... papers published, which differed... which were very similar, but differed in their redox potential and showed that only ones of these below a certain potential would be supravital stains, whereas all the others would be reduced and so bleached, and that's one of the things I did then.
>
> I also did another, which... which is an interesting experiment and which laid the basis for much of my later work, and it was a paper that showed that Claude's microsomal particles were the same as what the histologists were calling chromodial substance or ergastoplasm, which is they had to do with protein synthesis.
>
> Now I think what's interesting is the way I did this. Right, Claude had fractionated cells, these ribonucleic acid particles in an ultracentrifuge and had showed that they came to occupy a certain band in this, and they contained nucleic acid and they of course are the ribosomes as we now know them, the seat of protein synthesis. All the histologists had stained sections with dyes, of which the famous one was methyl-green pyronine, with a pyronine-stained chromodial substance or... or ergastoplasm, as it was called – red – and of course this... these were also supposed to be ribonucleic acid, but how could you tell if the particles were sub-microscopic – you couldn't see them.
>
> So what I did was: there were no ultracentrifuges, so I decided to use each cell as an ultracentrifuge and so I built a Beams and King air turbine ultracentrifuge, took pieces of liver, put them in this ultracentrifuge and spun them at this high velocity which I could get in an air driven turbine, and then cut sections of them so that each cell was like a little ultracentrifuge tube, and showed that the ergastoplasm sedimented in this cell to the same level that it did in a test-tube, above the glycogen, whatever.
>
> And there... I was very proud of that experiment... also led to something which I could write about later, the same experiment, which I published later, which was something called the Chromatic Nuclear Membrane, because I showed that there was chromatin that you couldn't spin off a nuclear membrane, which I believe is now coming back into fashion these days. But that was an interesting thing because it's the conception of translating one thing into the other...

*[Q] And then you stained them, of course?*

> Of course, I stained them, I cut sections, I embedded them. I stained them and found a lot of things with this and incidentally I... you know, I intend to use that again in my present research to try to concentrate the ribosome or particles in a cell for in situ localisation, this is just a very old technique. Now, I published that in 1948 in the South African Journal of Medical Sciences and was actually amazed, when I went to America, that people had read this and... and found, you know... so, that I would say is my first connection with what, you know, one would say is the modern molecular biology of ask... modern cell biology of trying to ask which are the parts of the cell doing this and I still think that that wasn't histochemistry.

## 42. Experiments: really finding things out

> Of course during this period every one of one's colleagues has always said that the book that influenced them most is *What Is Life*. A little book written by Erwin Schrödinger, which... you know, which people say: 'Were it not for Schrödinger, I would be playing the violin and collecting money on a... in an underground station in... in the tube'.
>
> And I actually read this book myself and in fact I have a copy here which you can see was bought in 1944, so I'd read this at a very early stage and I must say that I don't recall getting anything out of it in terms of what other people claim to have got, namely that it introduced them to the concept of the gene as a molecule and so on. I remember reading it as, as very interesting, of course I knew all about genes and chromosomes and this stuff seemed to me to be a bit amateur. I didn't understand the... the entropy part of the argument but in fact I have an inscription in my book which is a quotation from Faraday and, which said... says something and must be my... my impression of it at the time, and it says here:
>
> *"Let the imagination go, guarding it by judgement and principle, but holding it in and directing it by experiment."*
>
> So that is just the evidence it says... well, it's a great story but you know where are the experiments to tell you that it's true? And I think that that – which is written there, at the time – just says what... what this influenced me, and I think it's been very important, at least in my approach, which is that **you've got to really find out**.

---

## 43. Cambridge or Oxford?

> So during the course of my sort of dual career as a kind of reluctant medical student, together with being a practising scientist and I should say, also later on, a lecturer in physiology and a tutor all at the same time, I have come to the conclusion I've got to go abroad, and after the war, of course, many people did.
>
> I had already turned down this offer of Le Gros Clark but thought, this is really what I wanted to do, and in... I think it was 1948, Waddington came out to South Africa and... myself and a very good friend called George Clayton, and... were asked to look after him. We became responsible for this, Waddington was a great physiologist... embryologist and part of the school, and remained after that a friend for life. And he told me about Cambridge and all the interesting things that were going on in biochemistry in Cambridge. He had just moved to Edinburgh to start this – he said of course I could come to Edinburgh but if I wanted to go to Cambridge, that's where biochemistry was going.
>
> So I thought: well, I'll apply to Cambridge. So I applied; I wrote to Chibnall, who was then the professor, and I never got a reply.
>
> In the meantime, the principal of my university, Humphrey Raikes, a very great man, I had told him that I really wanted to go to England; I wanted to do this. So he said to me, 'Well there is a man at Oxford who is interested in these things; he's called Hinshelwood', because it turned out that Humphrey Raikes was a physical chemist at Oxford and knew about Hinshelwood, and his college was Exeter College and Hinshelwood was a... he... he was Dr Lee's Professor of Physical Chemistry there, and Hinshelwood had written a book called *The Chemical Kinetics of the Bacterial Cell*.

---

## 44. Hunting for future-proof sciences

> I was very active in hunting around as a naive young man for those sciences that could stand me in good stead for the future, which is a ludicrous activity. You know, you kind of say, 'Well, look, I think it's going to be topology that's going to give you the breakthrough', so you go and learn topology, you see. And I had been through things like rheology – I had a great passion on rheology – and I knew everything about thixotropy and rheopexy because I thought trying to find out all about the physical chemistry of cytoplasm wasn't a bad idea and I knew it would have something to do with physical chemistry.

*[Q] Did you have a clear formulation of the problem in your mind?*

> No, I... I just knew that, you know, we had to get in there and do things. I think, at this stage the concept of information as separate from matter had not yet crystallised; that crystallised during this period prior to my going by reading von Neumann and my contacts with Seymour Papert, but I realised that this whole idea that the genes have to carry information and that there was no explanation of that.

*[Q] You came to that before you went? Could you just explain...*

> Yes, yes, in fact I had a theory of protein synthesis before I went to Oxford.

*[Q] I'm afraid you must explain this a little bit.*

> Yeah. So what had happened was I then applied to... to Hinshelwood and was accepted; I read his book *The Chemical Kinetics of the Bacterial Cell*. It's full of equations. It didn't say too much about the stuff that was going on there, which I realised was the important thing, but in the meantime... and I won one of these Royal Commissions for the Exhibition of 1851 Scholarships. There was only one a year to South Africa... for South Africa, and I won it and Seymour got it I think... his... a year or two later and that brought him to Cambridge. This was a great set of scholarships and so that got me to Oxford.
>
> But prior to this I had started to grapple with this business with the coding problem, as it's known now, and I got... I read Astbury's paper because I was an assiduous reader of... of symposia. I decided symposia tell you a lot of things and so I read all these articles there because... reading the literature in the sense we know it now. And I read an Astbury in the *Society for Experimental Biology* – the English one, symposium there – in which he pointed out this relationship between the step size of nucleic acid, 3.3Å units, and the step size of amino acids, 3.5Å units, and had discussed there about the amino acids being determined by the nucleic acid. There... yes, it's very early. Okay.
>
> And so... and Dounce of course had already written such coding papers. And in fact later I learnt that Hinshelwood had written a coding paper and there was a ferment of business and so I had actually developed, before I went to Oxford, an idea that in fact nucleic acids and amino acid and proteins were co-synthesised through aminoacyl nucleotide intermediates and I'd had the naive idea that they came in this way and in fact the... the base was joined to make a nucleic acid because we knew all that chemistry; had no idea about base pairing. And at the same time the amino acid was joined to make this and it was very crude... idea, but in fact I had a mechanism – what was very hot at that time was actophosphate bonds, and high energy phosphate bonds, and this seemed to me to fit pretty well and I had these great ideas that this is how you make proteins and specify them.

---

## 45. John von Neumann and the history of DNA and self-replication

> What influenced me the most was the articles of von Neumann. Now, I had become interested in von Neumann not through the coding issues but through his interest in the nervous system and computers and of course, that's what Seymour was interested in because what we wanted to do is find out how the brain worked; that was what... you know, like a hobby on the side, you know. After... after dinner we'd work on central problems of the brain, you see, but it was trying to find out how this worked.
>
> And so I got this symposium, the Hixon Symposium, which I had got to read. I was, at that time, very fascinated by a rather strange complexion of psychology things by a man called Wolfgang Köhler who was a gestalt psychologist and another man called Lewin, who was what was called a topological psychologist and of course they were talking at a very different level, but in this book there is an article by Köhler and of course in that book there's this very famous paper which no one has ever read of von Neumann.
>
> Now of course later I discovered that those ideas were much older than the dating of this and that people had taken notes of them and they had circulated. But what is the brilliant part of this paper is in fact his description of what it takes to make a self-reproducing machine. And in fact if you look at what he says and what Schrödinger says, you can see what I have come to call **Schrödinger's fundamental error**, and in fact we can... I can find you the passage in that.
>
> But it's an amazing passage, because what von Neumann shows is that you have to have a mechanism not only of copying the machine but of copying the information that specifies the machine, right, so that he then divided the machine – the... the automaton as he called it – into three components: the functional part of the automaton; a... a decoding section of this which is part of that, which actually takes the tape, reads the instructions and builds the automaton; and a device that takes a copy of this tape and inserts it into the new automaton, right, which is the essential... essential, fundamental...
>
> And when von Neumann said that is the logical basis of self-reproduction, then you can see where Schrödinger made his mistake and this can be summarised in one sentence. **Schrödinger says the chromosomes contain the information to specify the future organism and the means to execute it and that's not true. The chromosomes contain the information to specify the future organisation and a description of the means to implement, but not the means themselves**, and that logical difference is made so crystal clear by von Neumann and that to me, was in fact...
>
> The first time now of course, I wasn't smart enough to really see that this is what DNA is all about, and of course it is one of the ironies of this entire field that were you to write a history of ideas in the whole of DNA, simply from the documented information as it exists in the literature, that is a kind of Hegelian history of ideas, you would certainly say that Watson and Crick depended on von Neumann, because von Neumann essentially tells you how it's done and then you just... DNA is just one of the implementations of this. But of course, none knew anything about the other, and so it's a... it's a great paradox to me that in fact this connection was not seen.
>
> Linus Pauling is present at that meeting because he gives this False Theory of Antibodies there. That means he heard von Neumann, must have known von Neumann, but he couldn't put that together with DNA and of course... well, neither could Linus Pauling put his own paper together with his future work because he and Delbrück wrote a paper on self... on self-complementation – two pieces of information – in about 1949 and had forgotten it by the time he did DNA, so that of course leads to a really distrust about what all the historians of science say, especially those of the history of ideas.
>
> But I think that that in a way is part of our kind of revolution in thinking, namely the whole of the theory of computation, which I think biologists have yet to assimilate and yet is there and it's a... it's an amazingly paradoxical field. You know, most fields start by struggling through from, from experimental confusion through early theoretical, you know, self-delusion, finally to the great generality and this field starts the other way round. It starts with a total abstract generality, namely it starts with, with Gödel's hypothesis or the Turing machine, and then it takes, you know, 50 years to descend into... into banality, you see. So it's the field that goes the other way and that is again remarkable, you know, and they cross each other at about 1953, you know: von Neumann on the way down, Watson and Crick on the way up. It was never put together.

*[Q] But... but you didn't put it together either?*

> I didn't put it together, but I did put together a little bit later that, because the moment I saw the DNA molecule, then I knew it.

*[Q] And you connected the two at once?*

> I knew this.

## 46. Schrödinger wrong, von Neumann right

> I think he made a fundamental error, and the fundamental error can be seen in his idea of what the chromosome contained. He says... in describing what he calls the code script, he says, "The chromosome structures are at the same time instrumental in bringing about the development they foreshadow. They are law code and executive power, or to use another simile, they are the architect's plan and the builder's craft in one." And in our modern parlance, we would say, "They not only contain the program but the means to execute the program". And that is wrong, because they don't contain the means; they only contain a description of the means to execute it.
>
> Now the person that got it right and got it right before DNA is von Neumann in developing the logic of self-reproducing automata which was based of course on Turing's previous idea of automaton and he gives this description of this automaton which has one part that is the machine; this machine is built under the instructions of a code script, that is a program and of course there's another part to the machine that actually has to copy the program and insert a copy in the new machine. So he very clearly distinguishes between the things that read the program and the program itself.
>
> In other words, **the program has to build the machinery to execute the program** and in fact he says it's... when he tries to talk about the biological significance of this abstract theory, he says: "This automaton E has some further attractive sides, which I shall not go into at this time at any length".

---

## 47. Schrödinger's belief in calculating an organism from chromosomes

> One of the central things in the Schrödinger's little book *What Is Life* is what he has to say about the chromosomes containing the program or the code, and he says here... on page 20, he says: "In calling the structure of the chromosome fibres a code script, we mean that the all penetrating mind once conceived by Laplace, to which every cause or connection lay immediately open, could tell from their structure whether the egg would develop under suitable conditions, into a black cock, or into a speckled hen, into a fly, or a maize plant, a rhododendron, a beetle, a mouse or a woman".
>
> Now, apart from the list of organisms he has given, which falls short of a serious classification of the living world, what he is saying here is that if you could look at the chromosomes, you could compute the... you could calculate the organism, but he's saying something more. He's saying that you could actually implement the organism because he goes on to add: "But the term code script is of course too narrow. The chromosome structures are at the same time instrumental in bringing about the development they foreshadow. They are law code and executive power, or to use another simile they are architect's plan and builder's craft in one."
>
> What he is saying here is that the chromosomes not only contain a description of the future organism but the means to implement that description or program as we might call it. That's wrong, because they don't contain the means to implement it, they only contain a description of the means to implement it and that distinction was made absolutely crystal clear by this remarkable paper of von Neumann, in which he develops and in fact provides a proof of what a self-reproducing automaton – or machine – would have to... would have to contain in order to satisfy the requirements of self-reproduction.
>
> He develops this concept of course from the earlier concept of Turing, who had developed ideas of automata that operated on tapes and which of course gave a mechanical example of how you might implement some computation. And if you like, this is the beginning of the theory of computation and what von Neumann has to say about this is made very clear in this essay.
>
> And he says that you've got to have several components, and I'll just summarise them. He said you first start with an automaton A, "which, when furnished this description of any other automaton in terms of the appropriate functions, will construct that entity". It's like a Turing machine, you see. So automaton A has to be given a tape and then it'll make another automaton A, all right.
>
> Now what you have, you've got to have... add to this automaton B. "Automaton B can make a copy of any instruction I that is furnished to it", so if you give it a program, it'll copy the program. And then you have... you combine A and B with each other and you give a control mechanism C, that you have to add as well, which does the following. It says, "Let A be furnished with the instruction I". So you give... you give the tape to A, A copies it under the control of C, okay, by every description, so it makes another copy of A, then you... and of course B is part of A. Then you... C then tells B, "copy this tape I", gives B the copying part of it, this copies it and then C will then take the tape I, and put it into the new machine, okay, and turns it loose as he says here, "as an independent entity".

## 48. Automata akin to living cells

> Von Neumann noted that "the instruction I is roughly effecting the functions of a gene" and that "the copying mechanism B performs the fundamental act of reproduction, the duplication of the genetic material."
>
> Von Neumann proposed these ideas in the late 1940s, published in early 1952. Despite their accuracy, these concepts had minimal impact on the biological community, possibly due to cultural differences between physicists/mathematicians and biologists.

## 49. Biology doesn't allow for relaxing baths

> The trouble with theory in biology is it's not like that in physics, there's no way you can use it. You see... I mean, Leó Szilárd used to tell me that the one thing that happened when he went into biology is he couldn't take a nice bath. When he was a physicist, he could go into a bath and he could lie there for three hours and he could think about physics, but he said when he went into biology, no sooner did he get in the bath then he'd have to get out and look up another fact. So he was always unable then to take a... a relaxed bath, and I think that is the nature, because you have to ask yourself, who... you know, what had this all been about, because this is one of those remarkable things in biology that is, you know, absolutely true, yet absolutely vacuous.
>
> There's nothing you can do about it. I mean, it tells you how things might work; it doesn't tell you how you can make a mouse. That's in the end... we're always preoccupied with these questions of detail. So that's... but I think, you know, having had this connection with this kind of thinking, having, you know, tried to teach myself enough mathematics at least to be able to deal with a mathematical argument, but I think, you know, the thing that I've always realised I'm much better at is actually, you know, **doing the real thing in a lab**.

## 50. Work on phage with Hinshelwood in Oxford

> What happened when I got to Oxford, as I saw Hinshelwood... and I had discovered this book *Viruses*, 1950, a little symposium held at Cal Tech and I'd read about phage. And... bacteriophage. And Hinshelwood was then working on drug resistance in bacteria and so he wrote to me and said he'd like me to work on bacteriophage resistance, to show it's an adaptation. I had read about phage and got very excited by *Viruses*. It's a remarkable book, that *Viruses*, 1950.

*[Q] Who's it by?*

> It was a symposium at Cal Tech; it's by various people and it is the beginnings of the... the phage... phage ideas there, you know, and really what is a virus? I mean... which you know was going to become clear in the next 20 years.
>
> And so I started to work on bacteriophage and I started to read about them. Hinshelwood wanted me to work on resistance because he was a great believer in the time that bacteria adapted to certain situations and then what was inherited was in fact the adapted state and he didn't believe in mutation. Strictly speaking, he said that the evidence that people had didn't support the idea that there were mutants. That was his... his thing.
>
> Now, I think in modern language we will see that those ideas are pretty common today, like we don't call it inheritance, we can say the persistence of, or the descent of, a certain determined state, which is not because there's been a gene mutation, but because there's a self-perpetuating state. And of course, he came in, he was very... he was very controversial, and so I started to work on bacteriophage resistance in a physical chemistry lab which was totally unequipped to do any biological work.
>
> We had to... we were given a pressure cooker and thirty glass petri dishes and some pipettes and you had to make your own petri dishes and all the pipettes were Pasteur pipettes which you had to plug yourself, and sterilise in an oven. And so each experiment became a logistic effort and amongst other experiments that I did – it's all in my DPhil thesis – is I repeated the Luria-Delbrück fluctuation experiments. I think I'm the only person in the world who's repeated them because Hinshelwood didn't believe... didn't believe in them. And I repeated them, and this got me into the whole area of genetics of mutations and so on, and I started to work on the side, on other problems.
>
> What I wanted to work on was lysogeny because I thought that would... Hinshelwoodian theories could easily explain lysogeny – that is, the switch between lysogenic and lytic – and what he was doing was trying to explain resistance. And I'll never forget... and I tried to explain it to him at the end, I said to him... I said, 'Professor, in science as in life, it is important to distinguish between chastity and impotence. The outcome is the same, the reasons are fundamentally different.' Okay.
>
> So... that I've used... this is a very important... it's a difference between can't and won't basically. So, mutation says you're bacteriophage resistant, because you lose a receptor to bind the bacteriophage; that is impotence, okay? Now the other is you choose to be chaste, you see, so that can be done by a... a thing like this, and so that I think is a very important way of doing it.
>
> However, I was the first person in that group who ever argued with him. It was absolutely unheard of, that one would actually challenge the professor, because we were still in those days you know where the Herr Geheimrat was right at the top and actually I got on extremely well with him and in fact, you know, just argued with him. And... but he was someone who, if you could show him an experiment, that was the thing that convinced him, and I think at the end of the day he was willing to think that some things were due to mutation.

*[Q] But you were the only biologist there?*

> I was the only person with a biological background. Other people were kind of chemists that had done this.

## 51. Taking advantage of Oxford University

> But in the meantime, I took advantage of Oxford. For example, I had to go and get phages, so I got them from across the road in the pathology department when I met some people there that were working on phage as phage... were working for Sir Paul Fildes, who was a member of the old school of microbiologists, you know; came every morning to the lab in a bowler hat and striped car... trousers and so on – a very nice man. One of the important people for antimetabolites, the whole background of, you know, sulphonamides and so on, and what that led to, and I got to know them, and I got to know some people there; I got to know people in the biochemistry department, because I had to learn about bacteria.
>
> I actually got to know people in the organic chemistry department because I had discovered that some phage mutants were also tryptophan deficient. That had been known, but I got one of these and I decided to go and find out why they were, so I started to work on tryptophan biosynthesis and I got a theory of what might be happening, if I had to go and make one of the intermediates. And so I went across to the Dyson Perrins Laboratory where I got hold of a bench and was doing there.
>
> One morning, Sir Robert Robertson... Robertson swept in and started to ask me what I was doing, got very interested in, and I couldn't explain to him that I was a... an intruder and apparently, about a week later, he came in and asked where this interesting person had gone, because I'd done my work and disappeared and so... but in fact, again, you see, that is very interesting because if you want to... I needed these intermediates; you couldn't get them anywhere, so the best thing is to go and make them. I mean, how do you make them, you get hold of a paper and it says, you know, take two teaspoonfuls of this compound and stir well in, so I did it, you see, and I made it, I crystallised it, but **this is something you can always do... it's open to you. There's no magic in this** and I think the whole of the philosophy that says unless you've gone through this way, if you're an old chap of 25, you can't do it. What you have to be is 18 and naive and go to a course and learn how to do it. This is just absolutely untrue.

## 52. Professor Dawkins and "Quest for Corvo"

> So I spent two years at Oxford, and of course being A, a scientist; B, a colonial, never really participated in the Oxford scene except for one rather interesting man that I met and my... Humphrey Raikes said to me I must go and meet Professor Dawkins, whom he remembered as an undergraduate. Now, one of the books that I became... I was very impressed with reading, was a book called *Quest for Corvo* by AJA Symons, and this is about a complete sort of, strange man who... I mean, the book has to be read really. Corvo was his pen name; I've forgotten his...

*[Q] CH Rolfe.*

> Rolfe, yes. F Rolfe, not CH Rolfe.

*[Q] Yes, sorry, you're right.*

> Yes, and he believed he was destined for greater things and should be a cardinal. He became famous in the seventies; he wrote a book called *Hadrian the Seventh*, one of his novels. But one of the people that sheltered him was Dawkins, who was then Head of the British School in Rome *[sic]* and he had later become professor of Medieval Greek at Oxford, and when I came to meet him he was very old and retired and I used to go and have tea with Dawkins every now and then. In fact, we once had him to dinner, and I still have in my... my possession a letter that he wrote to me. He had a typewriter with half the keys missing so that the letter would be typed and all the missing letters then filled in by hand.
>
> He... he was very interesting because I listened for hours to the stories of these strange... this strange sort of literary activities of... of this... because, as you know, they formed a Corvo Society where they read papers. AJA Symons, who had written about this man was also another strange man; who was the founder of the Food and Wine Society, collected music boxes which he left, and a brilliant biography of AJA Symons who was equally a phoney as was Corvo, was written by his brother, Julian Symons, the detective novelist.
>
> So this had the thing. And of course, when I got to King's College and our... one of our old provosts, Sheppard – Sheppard was an old crony of Dawkins – and so, again, I got... re-turned the wheel and listened to these wonderful stories of going to Monte Carlo, you know, in the '20s to gamble, where you actually went on the Blue train and left your boots outside to be polished, but the concept of wearing boots to Monte Carlo just seems today so bizarre in the extreme. However, this is so... you know, because I love these connections, you know, that start from nowhere and sort of bring these two worlds that you only read about in books together. So *Quest for Corvo* is worthwhile reading because it's a literary thing.

## 53. The Surprise of England

> Coming to Oxford was of course a great surprise in many ways, and one had... I had an image of England which was completely distorted, and of course I... that, one realised as this... as the boat docked at Southampton, on a very cold morning and I looked out, everything was much smaller than I had imagined it to be. Of course, coming from South Africa, where distances were enormous, the whole idea that things that were far away were 30 miles apart was... was... came as a surprise and of course coming to Oxford on that day and... was again a surprise to me, and a shock in a way because I had come to learn of the death of Harold Daitz on that very day.
>
> However, I did settle down. I got myself digs as they were, with... in Herne Road. Of course, there was food rationing in England which I hadn't... couldn't understand, and so I had to give all my landlady all my points for meat so that I could have a breakfast there, and the important people that I met in Oxford... and of course Oxford was not very interested in scientists at the time; scientists were second-class citizens; and of course colonials were in the second division of the second-class.
>
> And so one's social life was quite restrained – had almost nothing to do with the university – but there had been set up in Oxford for the benefit of scientists a kind of postgraduate club called Halifax House and it is through that... it was just across the road from the physical chemistry laboratory where I worked and through that that I met **Jack Dunitz**.

## 54. My secret input into the DNA model

> Now, Jack Dunitz was a crystallographer, and he had been at Cal Tech until he had returned to Oxford to work in... in Dorothy Hodgkin's laboratory. And it is Jack who knew Pauling and Jack and I had many discussions and started discussing things including my ideas about DNA and... DNA and how to determine the structure of DNA which was just complete nonsense I should say, because my idea was that you did it by... by binding dyes to it – proflavine – and then look at ultraviolet dichroism and I thought you might be able to crystallise it with a dye.
>
> I also through... through Jack met Leslie Orgel who was also at Oxford, a theoretical chemist, and we started a little group of meetings in which I talked to them about genetics and of course I learnt a little bit about structure from them. And it was through Jack later that I heard... I heard in about November of that year – this is November 1952... I heard through Jack of this idea of Francis Crick about helical diffraction. It was a paper that Francis published prior to the DNA which is *The Theory of Helical Diffraction [sic]*, and which of course leads to the interpretation of the X-ray structure.
>
> One interesting sidelight that... was that I was visited in January of that year, of the next year, or sometime around that, but certainly prior to the publication of the DNA structure, by Jerry Donohue. Jerry Donohue was a friend of Jack's and he came to visit me in the physical chemistry library and we were talking about the DNA bases, and I just drew one of them and he said, 'Why do you draw it this way?' And I said to him, 'Because I've always drawn it this way. This is the way I've seen it in the books that I have read.'
>
> Now, it's quite interesting; I mean, I can't say that there was a direct connection, but it was Jerry that pointed out to the people that they were using the incorrect tautomer and it is a... and I had found this and of course I... I had it in a... in a paper. Most people drew the bases in the OH form. Of course, that's the wrong form, rather than in the Keto form which is the correct form to see the base pairing, so it may have been a little bit of input prior to... to that as well and it was just... I mean, I didn't have any profound chemical understanding, I just simply... just always looked at it this way and didn't think of it in any other form.

## 55. The DNA model: the beginning of molecular biology

> Of course the most important thing that happened there is that Jack Dunitz then told me... we heard about all the developments with DNA because Jack was following it, and he told me that Francis Crick and Jim Watson had solved the structure of DNA and that... and we decided to go across to see it, and this was in April of 1953.
>
> Jack and I and Leslie and another crystallographer went to Cambridge, and that's where I met Jim Watson and Francis Crick, and that's where I saw the DNA model for the first time, in the Cavendish, and **that's when I saw that this was it. In a flash you could just see that everything... you know, this is... this was the fundamental... the curtain had been lifted and everything was now clear what to do.**
>
> And I got tremendously excited by this, and saw that one was justified. Of course I was working on phage, and Jim had worked on phage, and of course both of us had done extremely trivial work on bacteriophage. He did radiation sensitivity and I of course was doing absorption and mutation, but I think that it was coming through that and through Jack getting the contact with Cal Tech and via that with Francis and with Jim.
>
> I spent that... I talked a lot to Francis on that day but I spent most of the day talking to Jim and walking around with him and I just knew that **this is the... this was really the beginning of molecular biology. This was it**, and sort of all the... the rather simple ideas that I was fumbling through, you know, just now reached immediate clarification.
>
> So I then decided that of course this is exactly what one must work on, and I went back to Oxford. I kept up... I kept correspondence with Jim, and Jim came to visit me later that year – that's in 1953. He came there, and he came on July 6th, and I know that because my... my youngest... my stepson, who was then seven, had a party, and of course what happens that Jim ate all the cake then. Jim was a great lover of desserts, and of course they were all terribly impressed by his appetite for... for cake. And Jim of course had come... Jim had other friends like Av Mitchison that he'd come to see in Oxford, and so I kept that up and when that had gone... of course, Francis had gone to America later in '53.

## 56. Crick, Watson and the first model of the double helix

> We went to Cambridge, and we went by car. It was a small car. It was very cold I remember, and the car wasn't heated. No one had heaters in cars. And we must have arrived in Cambridge in the late morning at, say, 11, or this. We went into the Austin Wing of the Cavendish Laboratory; I went in with Jack and Leslie, and we went into the room that was lined with brick, and there on the side there, I can remember was this small... was this model made of all the plate and the plates for the bases, and the... this is the original model with everything was screwed together, and I could see the double helix there.
>
> And Francis was sitting there – it's the first time that I met him – and of course he couldn't stop talking. And he just went on and on and on and on, and it was very inspiring, you see. And they talked really about... more about the second paper. See, Jim stood there, and Jim, I had the feeling was get... he was there at his desk in that room, which I came to occupy later when I came to the Cavendish. And Jim was... Jim was saying... well, you know, just interspersing, and of course I got talking more to Jim later on. Francis had to go somewhere, but I spent the rest of the day with Jim.
>
> Now, the... what we talked about mostly was... not was... not the structure itself, but of the biological implications. Namely that which appeared in the second paper, which of course at that stage neither papers had appeared. This was prior. The paper appeared in May, so the paper was expected in a few weeks. The second paper appeared a little later than that.

---

## 57. The first and second DNA structure papers

> The first paper just defined the structure, and this... and had nothing to do about the explanation of mutation and replication and so on. And then there was a second paper which did that. The first paper just said, 'We have... invented a... the structure of the one', and it has this last sentence: **'It has not escaped our attention'**. And that is simply because that was published side by side with the Wilkins-Franklin thing, you see, so it was just the structure. And then they put in this caveat phrase, and then they wrote a second paper which, by the way, nobody actually seems to have digested. Everybody compresses both. The second paper is the one that shows... discusses replication, discusses the problem of the unwinding of the chains, discusses it as the mechanism of mutation, the tautomers and so on, and also raises all the questions of the code, you see.
>
> You see, most people at the time, if you read the literature and read everything around it, you will see that people said, 'Well, unwinding the chains looks impossible'. And so immediately of course that brings you into a domain where it says, 'Well, although there is some structural evidence for this, some theoretical constraints have to be applied'. Now, in my philosophy, the **Don't Worry hypothesis** says that all of... all of those can be relegated to the future. But there was a guy in molecular biology later, a man called Cavalieri, who refused to accept the double helix, and he proposed a model in which there were two chains side by side, and then they could separate without unwinding. And there was this incredible argument that I had, because he thought I would support him. I said, 'I believe in it and also I don't know how the problem is going to be solved, but I believe in the structure'. And that's the same thing about all of these structures.
>
> So the Don't Worry hypothesis which I formulated at the time was, 'There must be an enzyme that breaks the chain, and then unwinds them, and then joins them again'. Now I thought, 'Nobody could prove this; you couldn't write it down'. Later, such enzymes were found – they're called, amongst other things, helicases – and they do this. So if you had rejected this and said, 'Look, you know, the double helix doesn't work because you can't solve the problem', then you might as well have just rejected everything and said, 'Let's go and do something else'. And I think that's **very important in biology** because you will frequently come up against these objections where people say, 'Impossible, can't be done', and you say, 'Well, let's just work on it'.

---

## 58. The real concept of the DNA code

> But that's also the first time when I saw that... I saw the real concept of the code there. Now that I think is the remarkable thing. That is that there were these two one-dimensional sequences, and **it is the reduction of biology to one dimension in terms of information that is the absolute crucial step**.
>
> Biology... biology had been three-dimensional, and a lot of people wanted it four-dimensional. But the whole idea that you could reduce it to one dimension is a very powerful idea. That you can just have linear sequences. Because it just makes the disentangling of everything so much easier to understand, makes copying easy to understand, it makes expression easy to understand, it makes the mapping easy to understand, and makes mutation easy to understand.
>
> And in fact once you've got this absolutely clear-cut conception, then you know, in this very small evangelical sect you realise that everybody else was talking nonsense.

---

## 59. Understanding the DNA model

> Well, I had been grappling to this, that there were things that you'd have to do, because I had had ideas that you synthesised DNA, nucleic acid and protein together. So to me this was okay. You know, I had the ideas of one-dimensional sequences, and of course I was very much intrigued by computers and the von Neumann thing, these are one-dimensional sequences as well; tapes, the Turing machine is a one-dimensional sequence.
>
> And so all of this, this whole idea of the embodying of information in this, is in fact a... an important and fundamental breakthrough in my opinion, and to see that... because... and also to get away from mechanism. See, at that time all the biochemists of the world were preoccupied, as where do you get the energy to make proteins? And we had to spend weeks, months saying, **'Don't worry about the energy, energy will look after itself; the important thing is how do you get everything in the correct order? How do you get everything to be specified in this order?'** That is, the genetic code is the thing.
>
> So I think that this is such an important and fundamental divergence from anything else in biology that it is, you know, a total discontinuity – at least this is the way that I've seen it – and it has of course constrained quite a lot of later developments in biology. And of course crystallises the actual problems you have to solve in a very clear-cut way, because now they do not remain sort of vague problems that... that you can just ask almost rhetorical questions about, but you can actually sit down and say, 'If I had a gene that I could do the fine structure, and if I had a protein that I could sequence, then I could show whether or not the gene was co-linear'.

---

## 60. Impressions of Watson and Crick

> My impression of Jim Watson was of this rather eccentric, bright person who seemed to be... didn't pay as much attention to me as I would have liked, and walked very rapidly, with long strides – because we went for a walk. And someone who knew all the people. You see, you have to realise that Jim... Jack Dunitz was my first meeting with someone who knew Delbrück, you see. So it... it's interesting, that – to see people that when you meet people who knew other people for the first time, this is quite interesting. Jack knew Pauling, you see. And you see, now here's Franc... here's Watson, Watson knew... knew Luria; I knew Luria's work, I was doing Delbrück-Luria experiments. To actually meet the people that had experiments named after them.
>
> See, in those days you know, we used to contemplate what made people famous. And we realised that in chemistry you had to have a piece of apparatus named after you. So today we remember Büchner by his funnel, Erlenmeyer by his flask and Liebig by his condenser, you see. In mathematics you have to have a theorem, or better still a lemma. And of course in biology, we didn't know what you had to have named after you. And so, you know, we... we contemplated what it was; you have a theory, of course. Later we found out what it... **you had a system**. An *in vitro* system. So there was the Nirenberg system. And this idea of having an... a system to do something was exemplified when much later I defined the rabbit as a system into which you put an antigen and from which you get an antibody, you see. So that was the idea. So that has gone now, I'm glad to say.
>
> Well, Francis, I... I just have not such... I mean, I was very impressed by his... the way he spoke. And by his enthusiasm. And of course you see, Francis had been a cell biologist, and he had studied viscosity with magnets. And that was... that interested me also, because I'd looked at those papers, you see, as well. Later on of course, so I just heard a bit about this, but no, I mean, Francis I had heard about before I met him as a crystallographer from Jack Dunitz. And as the forerunner of the interpreter of the helical diffraction.

---

## 61. Enzymologists reject the model of DNA

> The model wasn't accepted at all. You see, the... at that stage, you had the establishment. The establishment were all the biochemists, the big guys in... the big men in the world – people like Fritz Lipmann; there were all the people that were... Lynen, you know – all the people doing enzymology. The big man in this country was Tommy Work, who was trying to work on protein synthesis.
>
> And I think that this whole idea that you could have a structure which is a theory, that you could go from this theory to something that was biology, that you could do all these things like genetics, they didn't think... and as you know, I mean, **Chargaff just said that molecular biologists were people who practised biochemistry without a licence**.
>
> And in fact I remember one occasion – which was a little later than the period – where Francis had put forward the idea of the adaptor hypothesis. The adaptor hypothesis postulated that for each amino acid there'd be an RNA... well there'd be an adaptor, which we... later became the RNA, and there'd be one enzyme to join the two together. And the biochemists said, 'This is utterly impossible because... that there are going to be 20 enzymes to do this, because had they existed we biochemists would have already have discovered them, and we haven't, so it must be wrong'.

---

## 62. The fusion of genetics and biochemistry

> Well, I think the other most important thing was in fact the fusion of genetics and biochemistry, and it's worthwhile just looking back as to what a mess genetics got into. At the turn of the century, when genetics had become an established science, many people went into genetics because the problems they were working with were insoluble. And the most important one is TH Morgan. TH Morgan started life as an embryologist, and which he found intractable. And he has written in his book *Regeneration* that in fact... he turned to genetics because this would give him a new entry into development.
>
> And most of the early geneticists did that. To try to find genes and the mechanisms of these... of this. By the beginning of the war – that is after the first biochemical genetics in drosophila had been done, that is the eye colour – it had become clear that it... it was extremely difficult to get any deeper than just finding a mutant and finding out what it does. That is the purely descriptive level.
>
> And that is why when people started to work with neurospora, Beadle and Tatum started to do biochemical genetics, this immediately attracted people like Ephrussi and attracted people Jacques Monod into this, and of course by 1945 we had this idea that what genes do is control biochemical processes. And there it got stuck, and organismal genetics up to that time, beyond that time, had gone in the direction of population genetics.
>
> So it is the fusion of biochemistry and genetics that I think represented another thing which was completely absent at the time and that you could actually think of experiments which were designed to test the hypothesis. You could say, 'If this controls this enzyme, then it follows that if I get such and such a mutant the following would happen'. And that was such a remarkably interesting thing to be able to do in biology.
>
> And of course working with bacteriophage was very interesting, because I remember someone asked me, 'What statistical test do you use for significance?' You see, because normally in biochemistry you would do a subject by estimating the amount of calcium in the blood of an animal under different experimental conditions, then you do statistics to see if the differences were significant. And so I remember I said to him, **'We don't do any statistics... oh, I'm sorry, we do have one test. We plot our results on seven-cycle log paper – that is it goes over 10^7 – and you hold the sheet at one end of the room, and you stand at the other end of the room, and if you can see a difference it's significant'**.

*[Q] Sorry Sydney, why... why did you not do statistics? Because the results were so clear-cut?*

> Well, they were... they were a thousand times, a million times. And let me just go back to this thing, you see, because the other thing was **genetics is digital; it's all or none**. We didn't have to make any quantitative measurements. And when you think about it, it's very remarkable subject, or was at that time. That is, if you're testing a recombinant, either you get a recombinant or you don't. Later on you can actually measure how much recombination. But you can do everything by one and zero. You can actually do yes/no. And you can then do very remarkable results, very remarkable experiments, just on this, these very simple Boolean primitives in a way that you could not do in any other subject.

## 63. The power of luck and ignorance

> Jim has said that he was lucky. He said, 'You need a bit of luck'. Well, you do; everybody can do with luck – luck helps. But it's hard to say. I mean, you know, I've always said for myself that I was lucky to have been born at the right time, to have come to the right place, to have had my background and to have met the right people, you know, at the right time.
>
> And I think you could even argue that good luck can make bad scientists good. You know, bad luck can make... bad luck doesn't help anybody but good luck can be the mark of a... of a good scientist. So I think it's that.
>
> But it's actually... it's actually what I think is that certain subjects reach a certain stage and what they require is someone come and look at them from a completely different point of view. And **I'm a great believer in the power of ignorance. I think you can always know too much**. I feel one of the things of being an experienced scientist in a subject is it curtails creativity, because you know too much and you know what won't work.
>
> And I think what we should be doing is **spreading ignorance rather than knowledge**, because it's ignorance that allows you to do things. And so I believe that it is people who come from the outside, who have not been entrained into the standard approach, who can see things from a different way. Those I think are the people who will then make the new step.
>
> You see, because Gamow didn't know anything about molecular structure, he couldn't even... but he saw these from the point of view of... of a physicist, of a correspondence, which is what physicists dealed with, and he could pose the problem in a form that no biochemists could pose it, because that's not the way they thought.

---

## 64. Seymour Benzer

> Well, Seymour's a remarkable person. Seymour was trained as a physicist; Seymour was in fact an important person in the invention in the Transistor in his early work. He started that... he started working in solid state physics. And Seymour decided he would go into biology and wanted to learn this, and so the best thing he could do as a physicist was to go and work at Oak Ridge – the atomic energy – where the only thing he could work on was radiation, and by... and that's how he got into phage.
>
> But Seymour is a person who's come from things from the outside, and has the ingenuity of being able to formulate experiments and... and you know, carry them out...

## 65. Physicists preparing for biology

> On the other hand, those who came from physics and thought that they would find a new physics in biology just got lost in the metaphysical jungle, for the simple reason that, you know, biology is very low energy physics – that it's got... of course it's consistent with the laws of physics, otherwise if we weren't we wouldn't be here, and it's just chemistry... part of chemistry in a very particular mode. So I think many of the earlier discussions of the physicists were irrelevant.
>
> And I also think that what is another thing that's remarkable is **you can't prepare yourself, as I mistakenly believed as a young person, equip yourself with a theoretical apparatus for the future**. You know, so you learn group theories saying... could be important, or lattice algebra, and go around looking for such other tools, because I think it's good to know what there is. But I don't think you can, so to speak, equip yourself, because I think things take you from the back basically and surprise you.
>
> And someone once told me, 'What mathematics do I need to'... asked me, 'What mathematics do I need to do biology?' I said, **'The ability to count up to 20, that's all. You don't need much more from that. It's 20 amino acids, four bases, you might have to go to 64 at some stage, but you don't need much more than that.'**
>
> So I think that that's another interesting thing where we are mistaken in how we prepare ourselves, you know, for our heroic voyages of the future. **The best thing to do a heroic voyage is just start. Don't... don't equip yourself.**

## 66. Scientific interaction with Francis Crick

> Yes, I think that Francis had... has always had the ability to crystallise the questions in a remarkable... in a remarkable way. That is, he has formulated... and I of course, I have spent in later life, I spent 20 years sharing an office, I had many, many conversations with him.
>
> There were always two things that I think were important about our conversations was **never restrain yourself; say it, even if it is completely stupid and ridiculous and wrong, because just uttering it gets it out into the open**. And someone else will pick up something from it. And I think the people who will not say anything until they've got it fully worked out, and there are people like this, these are people who don't have what I consider to be the most important thrill about doing... science is the kind of social interaction, the kind of companionship that comes from two people's minds playing on each other. And I think that that's the most important thing: say it, even if it is stupid.
>
> And the second thing is... which is important, is that, at least in... in... for myself, in... in such... in such thing, is **always try... I've always tried to materialise the question in the form of: well, if it is like this, how would you go about doing anything about it?** So I've always tried to think of some experiment or... or somewhere where... where might get... one get hold of the information to test this.
>
> And Francis has always had that kind of... at least we've always had that interaction of this, and of course he is a very severe audience; you don't get away with things, you have to... you have to be thinking all the time, because he asks very penetrating questions.
>
> And, of course, one of the other things that I learnt through these interactions was to **get the scale of everything right**. It's very important; this is not... this is not done. You know, and you can tell by the drawings. For example, you know, very early on we realised that the amount of DNA in a bacterium is 1mm long. And it's in a bacterium that's 1μ. So the DNA has been folded up a thousand times. And the pictures that you see of a bacterium with a little circle in it are ridiculous.
>
> Furthermore, when you think that most of the bacterium is full of these ribosomes and that the correct picture is not that ribosomes move along the messenger, but the messengers, because the ribosomes are big... their diffusion is quite slow. But the messengers must be moving through the cell like a lot of... like a lot of hysterical snakes, threading their way through the ribosomes like this.
>
> And... and I've always thought of it as very good to try to get that picture over. I feel there's not enough done about this; people don't teach them some scales of anything and how molecules reach things and so on. And Francis... that's one of the things that we tried very hard to do: was to **stay imprisoned within the physical context of everything**.

## 67. Being a heretic got me to Cold Spring Harbor

> Milislav Demerec, who was Director of Cold Spring Harbor, visited Oxford in 1954 and got very excited about my heretical work on actual mutations. He asked me, "Won't you come to Cold Spring Harbor?" This opportunity led to my Carnegie Corporation Travelling Fellowship, and that is where I really got injected into the whole of modern science.

---

## 68. Overlapping triplet code: George Gamow's diamond code

> I did... I actually did experiments in Cold Spring Harbor, and actually wrote a... and I actually wrote a little paper from that work on... on tryptophan biosynthesis, which is very interesting. I had already started to think quite hard about the genetic code and it was then in that summer – this is 1954 – that when I arrived at Cold Spring Harbor I had already started to do my own research, theoretical research on this thing on what was called the overlapping triplet code. Very soon after Francis and Jim published their paper, George Gamow, who was a cosmologist and physicist, and who's renowned for his books on physics called *Mr Tompkins Meets the Universe* [sic] I think was one of them... George Gamow published a paper on a code for DNA. This was the so-called Diamond Code and... and it became clear that the standard problems of the code then were that there were 64 triplets, 20 amino acids, and so one had to do something to arrange these triplets in this form and Gamow provided one explanation.
>
> He thought basically that overlapping triplets... that is triplets overlapping by two would determine the code and he put it in... in a form which looked physical in the sense that he thought there were diamond shaped cavities on DNA which covered three bases and thought that the amino acids would fit into this and he showed there was a way of arranging these... these three bases, such there were 20 groups of them, and since this 20 came out to be the same as the number of amino acids, the natural amino acids, one thought **the magic number had been reached**, and that was the thing.

---

## 69. Overlapping triplet code: eliminating all overlapping triplet code

> So what this did was formulate the questions of the code for the first time in a really serious manner. The question became: could we test whether the code was overlapping? And that's where statistical analysis came in – using Poisson analysis to look at dipeptide frequency in known protein sequences. If the code was overlapping, then certain combinations of adjacent amino acids would be forbidden, and we could test this against actual protein data to eliminate all overlapping triplet code possibilities.

## 70. Seymour Benzer: the end of the classical gene

> Seymour Benzer's work was absolutely critical. His fine-structure mapping of the rII region of bacteriophage T4 really demonstrated that the gene was not indivisible – it had internal structure. This was the end of the classical gene concept. Before Benzer, people thought of genes as beads on a string, indivisible units of heredity. Benzer showed you could map mutations within a single gene, and that recombination could occur between points within the gene. This opened up the whole molecular analysis of gene function.

---

## 71. Main elements of modern molecular biology

> I've always felt that the three things that came together to create the modern period of molecular biology were, first of all, **Sanger's proof that proteins had a chemical structure** – that is, that there was a defined sequence of amino acids in a protein, which meant that there had to be information transfer to specify this.
>
> Secondly, the **Watson-Crick structure of DNA**, which showed immediately how information could be copied – the complementary base pairing gave you a mechanism for replication.
>
> And thirdly, what Francis called the **Sequence Hypothesis** – that the sequence of bases in DNA determines the sequence of amino acids in a protein. And with that came the genetic code, the table of transformation. And that really lays the groundwork for molecular biology.

---

## 72. Gamow: cracking the code

> Now, to go back to the... the coding... question, Gamow used to... lived in Washington, where he was a professor at the George Washington University. And I met Gamow at Wood's Hole that summer of 1954. I went up to Wood's Hole to... to visit Jim and Francis – they were there that summer – and Gamow was there as well, and Gamow was giving lectures on proteins. Gamow had a wonderful language. For example, his pronunciation you had to follow... oxytocin, he was a Russian so it was called ochitotzine, you see. Ah, vasopretzine, you see. So once... you had to get used to all of this, and Gamow had a completely... he got mixed up between cytosine and cysteine, and used the two terms interchangeably. So you had to really know the field to follow him.
>
> It used to be said that there were always sort of gentleman in... with crew cut hair and sober suits that came in to the back to the... Gamow's audience, who would be from the CIA or the National Security Council, who thought that they could crack this genetic code. And of course **cracking the code became the thing**.
>
> It is interesting to ask, to see the transformation of the use of the language, you see, because at the time the code was thought to be what we call the genome. Whereas what is the code is something that – and Francis has commented on this and... and – you know, we imagine it was something like the Morse Code, was a table. It said, you know; S dot, dot, dot, O dash, dash, dash, you see. And was a table of transformations and that we'd always thought of it in that way, and the famous table now of the genetic code is of course now done. Although you'll find that most people will still talk about the complete apparatus of the genome as the genetic code for an organism, and **that is wrong. It's the table of transformation**.

## 73. The annual phage meeting: Leó Szilárd

> During that summer I had... I was going to go across to... I'd spent the summer in Cold Spring Harbor; I met up with Jim, and there was the annual phage meeting...

---

## 74. Leó Szilárd

> Leó Szilárd was at that meeting, and this is where I met him. I was very impressed by him that with every talk that was given that he didn't like, he would get up; leave the front row. He would stand by the door for a few seconds to give the speaker another chance, and if he didn't, as was usually the case, he would then leave.

---

## 75. Caught in Hurricane Carol with James Watson

> I gave Seymour's paper at the Cold Spring Harbor meeting. And it had been arranged then that I was going to California to go to the Virus Lab and visit there, and it had been arranged then by Jim that I would go through... I would drive back with him across California and go to Pasadena.
>
> Jim had just learnt to drive and he had a Chevy convertible, and I had spoken to people that he'd driven across the States from the West Coast, who had had quite a hair-raising trip with Jim.
>
> Unknown to both of us, the famous hurricane Carolina... Caroline struck this coast, we had no radio, and so we drove into Boston to an appalling storm... there was a terrible storm that night, and I got up to find half the place was under water.
>
> The entire town was deserted. There was water everywhere. I'd never seen rain like this. We seemed to be the only people driving around. What we were doing is driving around the middle of the hurricane.
>
> It's only later that we discovered... that we were driving as the eye of the storm passed over Cambridge.

---

## 76. Coast-to-coast road trip with Jim Watson

> The first day we drove through New York State and we came to Albany. There was a tremendous storm and at the outskirts of Albany, Jim said, 'You drive'. Now, I'd never driven on the right hand side of the road. This was an absolute storm – lightning. I don't know how... where I was going. Never driven in America before. Somehow I drove through Albany without killing us, and finally we got to the other side and stayed the night in a motel and... with the two of us, and then the next day we drove to Chicago where I stayed a few days with Jim at his family home and met his family there.
>
> And then from there we went on to Urbana, where we stopped there for an afternoon – that's where I met Luria, Ed Lennox and all the people who were at Urbana – and then from Urbana we drove out west, stopping at various places. I can remember stopping in Colorado Springs after a day in which we'd been stopped by a traffic policeman in a small town in Kansas where they had a speed limit... a ridiculous speed limit like 25ft an hour. And I noticed this policeman tailing us and I said... I was driving, and I said to Jim, 'What do... what do we do?' So he says, 'Just drive', you know, so I drove extremely carefully, and just as we came to the border, the Colorado/Kansas border, this policeman stopped us. And he said, 'You went through a traffic light. Get out of the car... go through a traffic light.' I said, 'Well, I don't... I don't think I did, but if I did I'm terribly sorry', you see.
>
> However, it was very clear that he was trying to get us – this was a Friday, I remember – and Jim kept on saying, 'Don't argue with him, because he'll put us in jail and there'll be no judge till Monday, and we'll have to spend the weekend in jail'. So he asked to see my driver's licence. I showed him a South African driver's licence. He says, 'I see, you're out of state'. So I said, 'Yes'. So he then said to Jim, 'Are you the car owner?' 'Yes.' And then he went to look, and in California at that time the licence was wrapped around the steering wheel. And of course he read it and he said, 'Are you Mr Dewey?' Because Jim's middle name is Dewey – JD Watson. He was called after... by... his father had a great admiration for the philosopher Dewey at Chicago, and was called James Dewey Watson. He didn't like the name, and of course he didn't like the policeman calling him Mr Dewey. And I could see Jim getting very, very het up, and so I kept on saying to him, 'Don't talk back to him or we'll be in jail for the weekend'.
>
> However, we went to Colorado. I drove; I think a remarkable thing that... that made such an impression on me. I mean, having travelled a lot in South Africa, deserts and mountains, I mean, this was just fabulous, the scenery in the Rockies, and the desert scenery there... thereafter was so fascinating.

---

## 77. Preparing to die in the desert

> We then went through Monument Valley, which is where the four states meet, which is a desert, and it was hilarious because Jim said, 'You know, you can't get anything for 200 miles', or whatever it was, and he was... and, you know, he gave me pictures of disappearing there only, you know, to discover our bleached bones in the desert.
>
> And so while he... we went to a general store and while Jim was writing postcards to all his friends, you know, in Harvard saying, 'Farewell, we're about to embark on the desert', I who had travelled in deserts, you know, was getting equipped. That is, I bought an extra fan belt. This is the one thing; if you lose your fan belt you've had it. I actually bought water. I mean, Jim was buying ice cream, but I bought water. I bought canisters of water to take with me.
>
> I also bought a jar of... I think it was... it was butter, I think, that I got. Anyway, something that you could use on a piece of a shirt which you could coat to make a spare fuel pump. They had diaphragms in fuel pumps. I had been caught once with a collapsed fuel pump in a desert, and of course once that happens you've had it. And we made one out of a shirt and Vaseline, it... it was, which sort of held up. You know, got us to the next place.
>
> And of course all of this was just ridiculous. The desert was highly populated; you could get a Coke every now and then. The place was full of trucks of the Atomic Energy Commission, you know, collecting uranium. And so our great episode of landing up just as a pile of bleached bones never materialised.

---

## 78. Making plans with James Watson

*[Q] What about your journey with Jim? Did you actually talk science? I mean, you were together a long time.*

> We talked... we talked a lot of science, you know. But at that stage everything was at the beginning and everything was plans, you know, and plans can be very unsatisfying. I liked the story; we once had a... a Swedish biochemist came to visit us, and I said to him, 'What do you do in Sweden?' He said, 'Ah, in summer, the girls... the most beautiful girls in the world'. So I said, 'But summer's only six weeks'. I said, 'What do you do for the other 46 weeks?' He said, **'We plan for the summer'**. So plans are very unsatisfying and everything was plans, you know – we're going to do the co-linearity problem.
>
> At that stage people like Jim and to lesser extent Francis and people like Alex Rich believed that you would understand protein synthesis by doing the structure of RNA. And they had started to generate... to try and do this for RNA that had been done for DNA, and of course they were completely wrong. It never worked out that way. But that is what was believed, and that is what Jim was trying to do in Cal Tech at the time, and that is organise... organise that. I believed that what we had to go is from the genetics. To me that was the open door. You get genes, you make mutants, you study it, and as happened later, you know, **genetics just turned out to be the poor man's way of doing the DNA sequence**, or the man's way of doing it with... with his hands tied behind his back.

---

## 79. The RNA Tie Club

> Well, of course at that stage you have to remember that in 1953, '54, this is what we're talking about – '52 and '53 and '54, it's this period I'm talking about – there were very few people that even knew what we were talking about, you see, and if you look you can judge this by looking at who Gamow had in the RNA Tie Club. Gamow founded the RNA Tie Club, which was a club of people that were interested in coding. Everybody there was... were friends of Gamow, and so the... the club had 20 members, **each who had a name of an amino acid**. Needless to say, Gamow was alanine. And Francis, Leslie Orgel and myself were the last three. Francis was... Francis was tryptophan, Leslie Orgel was tyrosine, and I was valine, the last one. Of course alphabetical order there. And all the rest were friends of Gamow, so Nick Metropolis was a member of the Tie Club. Why? Because Nick Metropolis worked at Los Alamos on computers, and he was a friend of Gamow and they were going to crack the code with computers.
>
> The... the club had four honorary members, who were called by the bases. It had a... it had a Chief Optimist, that was Jim; a Chief Pessimist, that was Francis; these were the offices – it was a typical Gamow thing. He put it together, and I still have letters from him written on the notepaper of the 20th Century Limited.
>
> The remarkable story told about Gamow... Gamow had a job in Washington but was a consultant to Los Alamos, so travelled west very frequently and one day landed up in Chicago, which is where the trains... you had to change trains, and he ran out of money. And he went into this hotel and he started to... and he wanted to change a cheque; he had no money. But his cheque was on a bank in Woods Hole, the Falmouth Bank, and so he then produced – he then told him he was a professor in Washington, he produced his Los Alamos security card as identification – a... a bank in Falmouth, Massachusetts. So the young man there was looking very suspiciously at this character and what he was looking at was Gamow's tie pin. Because each member of the RNA Tie Club had a tie and a tie pin on which was printed his name. So he was looking at this thing called Alanine. So Gamow said to him... you know, he's saying, 'My name is Gamow', and so on. 'Oh,' he says, 'I see you looking at my tie pin'. He says, 'It's... it's Alanine there'. He says, 'I'll have to explain it to you'. He says... 'Tell me,' he says, **'how much do you know about the structure of DNA?'**
>
> So when I say it's a fringe thing, I mean, it certainly did not include people trying to change... to change cheques. But it was a fringe thing and it was a thing in which people seriously doubted. I can tell you without saying who was involved, but as 1958... the whole of DNA was still thought to be a flash in the pan, not right, you know, not known, not proven. And to actually believe in this in 1955 and actually start to do experiments on it, this was something that was just implausible. Because it was neither genetics, nor was it biochemistry.

---

## 80. The 'old days' experiments

> We came to Cal Tech, and that again brought me in direct contact with the Phage Group – the Phage Church – at which I met many people there that had become... you know, had become... had become lifelong friends. And I gave a talk on Seymour's work there again, and spent a few days there, and then went up to Berkeley to see the Virus Lab where I actually started to work with Gunther Stent.
>
> And what was so interesting in those times was **you could arrive at a lab and do an experiment**. You know, you didn't have to write a lot of paper. So the thing we got interested in were protoplasts. I wanted to do work on phage. Now, at that stage... and... and the whole idea that you could get the inside of a bacterium, a protoplast, and the whole idea of a little something less than the cell, therefore of great interest was something that... of course, now it's just ridiculous, because what we just took off was the hard carbohydrate cell wall and got to grips with the cell. But the experiment we did there was to show that protoplasts could continue to produce phage. And that actually started off a whole line of work on protoplast biology which people thought were the first steps to a sub-cellular system, which we didn't have, that would do complex things and... on which you could do biochemistry.

---

## 81. The gene protein problem

> I spent about eight weeks in... in the Virus Lab, and then of course the time came for me to go back. By this time I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I had formulated what had be... what we had come... was **the gene protein problem**. That is, we would investigate the correlation between genes and proteins by getting a gene on which we could do fine structure analysis, and then its corresponding protein on which we could do chemical sequencing. And the first question was to prove co-linearity. Namely that the mutations occurred in the gene in the same order with which they were present in the proteins.
>
> Now, of course that was inspired by work that had been done by Vernon Ingram, who actually showed that sickle cell haemoglobin, which Pauling had showed involved a chemical change, Vernon showed was a singular change, the conversion of one glutamic to a lysine, within one place in the haemoglobin. And he'd invented a fingerprinting method to show this. And so we were going to fuse these two technologies in order to start to investigate the relation between genes and proteins. And of course at that stage everything was enormously difficult to do. And you had to get large amounts of protein to do this. Haemoglobin... you can get grams of haemoglobin.
>
> And so we had... and what had happened then... I'm still travelling. I'm still travelling back with pieces of paper and I'm just filling in the background. And on the... and so one of the thoughts was the program that had been developed was that we would have to do, we would either have to find the protein of the rII gene, which actually never succeeded, or we would have to find another gene which... which did a phage and which... which specified something in the virus and on which we could do fine structure. And one of these genes was the host range, which George Streisinger was working on, and another of these genes was something in which... had been worked on and for which there was evidence, and it was cofactor requirement of bacteriophages. There were some bacteriophages that were not absorbed unless tryptophan was present. And so there were natural variations of this and I thought I could get mutants of these. That is something that Delbrück himself worked on, from the kinetic point of view.

---

## 82. The decision to join the Cavendish Laboratory

> So I returned to South Africa in December of that year – it's '54 – with the idea that I would start to work on the genetics of cofactor requirement in order to prepare the way for a full gene protein analysis, and that is something that I could do in South Africa. And so I was extremely depressed when I left America, because at that time I thought: I'll never see it again. You know, that was the end of the... the end of everything.
>
> But of course there were already conversations, when I came back to South Africa on the way I went to England, and there I talked to Francis, and there... there we had this discussion on degenerate coding and templates, and there we had the idea that I would come to join them in the Cavendish because **we were talking the same language**. However, I had to go back to serve my bondage, and all the wheels would be done to try and bring me back as... as soon as possible.

---

## 83. Going to South Africa

> Well, I went back to South Africa, and I set up a lab in the physiology department. I had plenty of space there. And I got a grant from the South African cancer thing to do cofactor, Phage Cofactor Genetics. And I actually did all of that there. I had very little equipment; I had a very nice girl that I could hire. Betty van Zyl, she was a Cape coloured girl, and I taught her how to pour petri dishes, and we had to do everything with quite primitive thing. But I'm very proud of that, because I actually did that paper. I actually did get recombinants for cofactor mutants, I developed methods of doing it, and I published it, and I was very proud because when I sent the manuscript to Max Delbrück, before I published it, he actually... he called together a seminar to discuss this important work. And of course this is what I took back to Cambridge.
>
> So I mean, to sit there... and I continued to work on my coding theory, and in fact by a... by 1950, early '54... by late '54, I had enough information, and I'd thought of a trick to actually prove that all overlapping triplet codes were impossible. And in fact that appeared the... I wrote an RNA Tie Club thing from South Africa that was circulated, and then Gamow was very... thought it very important, and it got published in PNAS. He submitted that paper. So that was my theoretical paper. That was... I think, if I remember, it was in '55. And that of course... it was entitled **'On the Impossibility of All Overlapping Triplet Codes'** and I'm very proud of that paper because that was done, as I say, you know, without... it was just really knowing how to divide by four, actually, which spurred... and it's a good paper, that. And I think did a lot... did a lot to clear up things.
>
> And of course at the same time Francis had come to the conclusion that the code was degenerate, that in fact we can't assign it, we can't deduce it from first principles. We just have to go and find out what it is. Which is what... what had to be done. So the... and then we had these negotiations which went backwards and forwards, and I was really wanting to get out of South Africa and this was going... and in the middle of this I got an offer of a job at Berkeley, to go there. Because I'd known Gunther Stent because of my time there. I was very... I was very torn between knowing what to do. I further got an offer from Josh Lederberg to go there, and the reason I got this, I discovered... to go to Wisconsin, and the reason I got this, I discovered is that Gunther Stent put my name on one of his grants, and Josh Lederberg saw this and decided, 'Well, if he's going to get him, I'll make a counterbid'. So I had these letters. I actually also got a letter from a company in England, saying Sir Cyril Hinshelwood had written to them.
>
> That was very nice but I was pretty desperate to go. And then finally the... the MRC came through and we arranged to leave and the reason I left then was I had come to the conclusion that I really wanted to be a scientist, and that lots of people had stayed back in South Africa and had become, you know, important people there. But **the testing ground is at the centre, the personal testing ground, and you've got to go to the... the metropolis**, if I can call it that, and you've got to test yourself at the international level, because otherwise you don't know whether you're any good or not. And so that's really what it was, and... and since at that time I believed that in Africa... in South Africa the colour of my skin would always, if things changed, make me an outcast, because that's the way it looked at that time. I just decided that I would just go and do science and that's how I went back and that was... that was a conscious decision.
>
> Over this period, yes. I... this correspondence exists of course and a lot of it is in Judson's book, and in this we... the idea was we would do the gene protein problem. We would tackle this problem in bacteriophage, and so a lab would be set up and... and in fact this... this... so this was the idea: we'd all get together and we'd do this work. And people had arranged to come from America. Seymour Benzer was going to come, George Streisinger was going to come, and in the Cavendish, this was where we'd do it.

## 84. Fred Sanger on the structure of insulin

> There's a club in Oxford called the Alembic Club which was for the discussion of chemistry, and I can remember – I think it must have been either late '53 or early '54 but certainly while I was at Oxford – of going to a lecture that was given by Fred Sanger and was on the structure of insulin, and he showed how he deduced the structure. I know he had a wonderful set of little blocks which he turned over to face the audience as he determined the little pieces of a structure, and the thing that struck me, because of course protein structure then was in a total impossible thing, and the thing that really impressed me was at the end of this lecture **Sir Robert Robinson stood up and said the following. He said, 'Dr Sanger has made proteins part of chemistry. He's actually shown this remarkable fact that these things have a chemical structure in the form of their sequence of amino acids.'**
>
> And until that time, you know, no one actually believed it. They all thought that they were polymers and things just joined together. There's something called the Bergmann-Niemann Hypothesis which said that things occurred with a frequency according to their abundance so they were repetitive structures, which of course you can't do very well because many things would come to occupy the same position so you can't have something that occurs every second position and another thing every third position, because what happens at position number six? You have a conflict.
>
> However, that was the state, and that I think was another signal achievement in pushing the subject on. But of course you see that again wasn't something that most people were doing, and Fred himself was always a fringe person in the biochemistry department here in Cambridge, and it's only when Fred left the biochemistry department and joined with us to go up the hill to make the Laboratory on Molecular Biology, but that'll come later.

## 85. Growing bacteriophage in a Hoover washing machine

> Well I arrived in Cambridge. I arrived in Southampton again after a long trip, but this time with three children, with a three year appointment for the MRC at a salary of £1,100 a year. I can remember that. It wasn't a tenured appointment, it was a short-term appointment, and this was in the end of December 1956, and we arrived here in Cambridge to take up the appointment from 1st of 1957.
>
> And we had to find places to live – it was very, very difficult, I mean, just adapting to this. The laboratory had to be built up from scratch, there weren't any kitchens and so on, and in fact we set about organising a laboratory to do phage work. And our dish washing was in our office, and from that day... there were seven desks in this office, it was mixed up with crystallographers; we had a bench in a chemical lab, and a number of people were hired including Leslie Barnett. Leslie Barnett was then a computer girl, that... in those politically incorrect times this referred to people who actually did the calculations for crystallography on mechanical calculators and there was something known as **the three-girl method**; that is you got three girls to estimate the density and took the average of their estimation. So, I mean, it was that, and then she joined me, and... because she had a degree in biology... and Kate Wilkins joined us, who stayed with us, and she started to do our dish washing and our preparation.
>
> And we got a lab going so that by the time the gang arrived in 19... at the... in September of that year, I'd already done quite a lot of experiments, and we were able to do experiments and one of the things that we started to do – already we were doing then – was to work on bacteriophage. This bacteriophage could be grown on E. coli, and we did this because we could purify it very easily and we could get lots of it.
>
> And there were wonderful episodes of how we needed to grow large amounts of this, so I conceived of the idea of growing them in a washing-machine and there was a... because that had... there was a Hoover washing machine, I remember, which was... from the top, and had a pump which circulated everything and I thought: well, you know this is exactly what we need to grow large quantities of... of phage, because we could grow them in this and then we could inoculate them. And so I wrote to the Hoover company, they gave me a washing machine and... in which we grew things, and we could only grow them once, and then nothing grew and the reason for that unfortunately is that the phosphate media so corroded the aluminium that in fact the thing was just useless.
>
> But however it... it was developing all of these things to... to make the material and that is where I... that is also during this time I started to work with the electron microscope. Now the reason to do this was simply that I thought we could just take bacteriophage apart, you know, because it was like a little thing and we could do what we called an anatomical dissection of it. Whereas all the other people said, 'No you have to treat it as a mixture of proteins and go on to columns and separate them', so **the whole idea that you could actually isolate chunks of it as a preliminary was... was certainly something that no one accepted at the time**, and this, we were able to show, could be done, and we did it in very simple ways.
>
> For example I discovered that if you put bacteriophage at pH2 – just acidified it – it went into a mass, and when you digested it with a mixture of enzymes you were only left with one little component, namely what came to be called later was the tail sheath. And so we did a lot of experiments like this and then we could actually start to produce these... these pieces of the phage.

## 86. Taking the electron microscope out of the hands of the elite

> Now, one of the interesting things which happened during the time, and actually was a side-effect of all of this work, was **the invention of negative staining**. Now, this is a very remarkable... technology because what it did was it took electron microscopy out of the hands of the elite and gave it to the people, basically.
>
> Now in those days if you needed to do electron microscopy you needed to have a professional electron microscopist. This is someone who knew how to shadow things with uranium, and he would evaporate uranium onto these objects and put them on the machine so that you could actually visualise them. Because... of course the electron microscope can see small things but it needs contrast in order to see them and this... biological objects don't have enough contrast – you need some kind of heavy... heavier compound there, with more electrons, that is – and so shadowing was part of the profession, and these electron microscopists had to be pampered, and if you were, say, working in the life sciences you had to find a collaborator who of course exacted a very high price for this collaboration.
>
> And I started to work with... with someone called Bob Horne, who was a very interesting chap, was working with the electron micro... microscope in the solid state physics group here in the Cavendish and... and we had great difficulties in visualising these things and doing the shadowing; it was all terribly slow. So I decided – having come from a background of cytology – I would try and stain these. And... and so I knew you had to stain them with heavy metals, and so I got hold of phosphotungstic acid, and the first thing I did is I measured its pH, and I discovered its pH was three. So I said, 'I don't put biological objects into such acid conditions', so I neutralised it and I took all these pieces of virus, and I sprayed them onto this grid, and we took them over and we looked at them.
>
> Now Bob Horne said, 'That's a mess, it's a total mess; everything...' But then I saw something, and I knew immediately what it was, and I said, 'This is called negative staining'. And how did I know this? Because in my medical course I had learnt to show how you'd look at treponema. Treponema is the age... spirochaetes. Treponema is the agent that causes syphilis, and one of the things you diagnose is you put a drop on a slide and you put Indian ink in it, and you see the treponemas as white objects transmitting the lights, swimming in the sea of ink, and **this is called negative staining, and this was invented in the 19th century for the optical microscope and we... and I understood that this was the exact image of this, but for the electron microscope**, so with this we could produce remarkable images.
>
> And it had two effects. One is it allowed at least the electron microscopy of small objects to go. But what happened is it took all the people working in virology and gave them a tool that they could all use and really wiped out the profession of electron microscopist in a biological lab because everybody could just do it. And of course it's been the... it's been a wonderful technique, it's been developed by... by many people, but it's again... I mean, in that sense, it's... it's being able to say, **'This picture, I've seen something like this before'**, and of course now I know it's got to do with syphilis. Of course you can't explain to someone that this is where venereal disease comes in but it's effectively... it's the images that map on to each other.

---

## 87. Anecdotes from the MRC lab

> Now I didn't pursue virus structure myself, because it was just a means to getting to the phage, but of course that sort of revolutionised how people could look at particles of all sizes, and for us it was just a tool that was very important, because also it generated I think in biology the ability through – of course the phage work itself – to start to think now about macromolecular assemblies which I think have become the important underlying thing in cell biology. **The molecular biology of the cell is how bunches of molecules get together and interact** and this was one of the methods that could do it.
>
> However, we did go on and we had a hilarious time here. Seymour Benzer felt the cold very severely. In fact, he was ready to go home. He came in... in October, and they were so cold here he was ready to go home, but I dissuaded him. I used to come and make a fire for him, and, you know, help him to keep warm, but Seymour's the only person that I know walks around with a sweater in Death Valley, you know the temperature's 120°F, he's always been cold. He always likes to sleep late. He's an owl. That is, he stays up all night. I have in varying parts of my life been an owl and a lark, and sometimes both, that is get up early and go to bed late, but Seymour was this, and I remember they called me up... *Time Magazine* called me that year because Beadle won the Nobel Prize, and they called me from London, and they said could they speak to... to Dr Benzer, and I said, 'Dr Benzer is still asleep'.
>
> Then they said, 'Did I know where to find Doctor Garrod?' So I said, 'Just hold on a moment, I'll check up'. Now I have to tell you what this is about. This is Archibald Garrod who's thought... thought to be... you know who is the real founder of modern biochemical genetics, the physician who deduced alkaptonuria as a biochemical defect and of course had long since died, and what I went to look up was his obituary to see where he was buried, you see, and so I could give them directions to the Highgate Cemetery where I thought they might be able to get him. In fact, I said, **'You're probably more likely to wake him up than you are Seymour Benzer.'**
>
> So... so Seymour did this. Then Seymour, George and I and Sewell Champe, who was a student that Seymour brought with him for this, we decided to have a lunch club. It was... of course food in England was atrocious in those days. You had the choice between a bad Chinese lunch and a terrible Chinese lunch, so we decided we would form a lunch club and we would cook for each other. And one person would go around, collect all the ingredients and then make a meal which we would all eat and such was the impulse to outdo each other that in fact people would start cooking two days before – George in particular, who was a gourmet... George Streisinger was a gourmet, and he actually went to Yarmouth to get mussels one day, so we could have the moules marinière, and this got to the stage we're spending more time on preparing these grand lunches, and of course what happened was Seymour killed it all because he came in one day when it was his turn with a rather shy smile on his face and produced four packets of fish and chips, said he'd got up too late to prepare the lunch, so that was the end of the lunch.

## 88. The MRC lab at Cambridge: X-ray crystallography

> In Cambridge, the laboratory as it was then called in the '50s – the Unit, the MRC Unit for the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems. This had been set up by the MRC for Max Perutz some years ago with the idea that crystallography could be of importance for medical research. The Medical Research Council was in fact persuaded by Keilin, who was a very formidable scientist – David Keilin – and of course who was interested in iron proteins. David Keilin discovered the cytochromes in the '20s, and this unit had been set up with the unlikely program of **determining the structure of protein molecules by X-ray crystallography**, which just seemed totally impossible for things of that size. And of course this was something that Max had worked on and of course there were forerunners, namely Bernal.
>
> Now, technically this was very difficult to do. First of all, the data were very hard to record, because the X-ray sources were not powerful enough. And so one of the things that became a part of that group – and that's why they were in the Cavendish Laboratory – was in fact to develop the physical instrumentation to do this. And of course this is where the rotating anode tube had been invented so that a more intense source of X-rays became available and so these crystals could be photographed.
>
> Now, one of the problems in doing X-ray crystallography is of course what's called **the phase problem**. What you measure is the amplitude of the wave and that is the square, but you don't know whether it's minus or plus. And if you have to look at, say, 400 reflections, this means you have two to the four hundred possibilities and so you can't do it in any other way but to determine phase. And for a long time the haemoglobin work that Max was doing just went very slowly, and in fact nearly all the work done up to almost the last time was wrong. In fact, Francis started by working on haemoglobin Pattersons and came to the conclusion it was a waste of time. Jim came to the lab to do X-ray crystallography on tobacco mosaic virus in the lab, because he thought that he could try and tell something about this. So Jim Watson came here. John Kendrew had joined Max Perutz after the war and he had started to work on another protein called myoglobin.

---

## 89. The MRC lab at Cambridge: Computers and determining structures

> One of the things that John did which was absolutely very far-sighted was he realised computers were going to be very important in this field. And very soon after the war he got involved with the developments that were going on here; in fact the first Fouriers were calculated on a hand-built computer in... in the Mathematical Laboratory here called Edsac II. This was a valve machine and... and in fact was something I remember I... I went there once, and there were a lot of comic books there, and I thought well, you know, these people. But it turned out **these comic books were used to fan the valves to try and cool the machine**. So it was... the machines were very hard to program, and in fact the whole of Autocode was invented for this, so that... the computing was a very important part – that was recognised. Plus of course all the other instrumentation.
>
> Now, of course Francis came as a physicist to do crystallography. Max and John... John had the first breakthrough on myoglobin. Well, Max had the fundamental breakthrough in which he showed the **isomorphous replacement method** could let you do phase. What you do is you put a heavy metal in one position in the protein and it adds its scattering to the... to all the others. So if the original scattering is positive, then they get stronger. If they were negative they get weaker – this is a very crude summary but it's roughly how you do it – and then you can compute the phase and then you can compute the structure.
>
> Now, it's... it's that structure I think, this sort of... the... the whole of doing that, when John got the first 6Å structure of myoglobin and it looked like just a roll of sausages, it was very thin, then Max got this, and of course over the years that has improved. And of course also there was work on muscle structure, muscle proteins, by Hugh Huxley who had also come into the lab, and he came along in the '60s. But also there were people like Aaron Klug coming into the lab.

## 90. Making mutant spectra with acid

> However, this was very exciting because we would be talking... saying, 'Well, we've got this gene, which is the R2, and we've got this protein', and the protein was part of the phage, we had... but of course we had the wrong gene and the wrong protein, so now what we must do is either find the right protein and get the gene for this, which is actually what happened after many hiccups, or we must try and find the R2 protein. But in the meantime we were working... had started work on chemical mutagenesis.
>
> Now, Seymour had been doing work on the induction of mutants by chemicals before he came and had shown that if you incorporated 5-Bromouracil into the phage, you got mutants. If you treated it with various reagents you got mutants and so on, and what had been developed was this idea of **mutational spectra** and we had also started some work on this but not... in a desultory way. What was the idea? The idea was not only would we tell the co-linearity but we'd actually decode the protein this way you see so if we could get a chemical reagent that we knew changed guanine to adenine, you know that is made that mutation, and we could then see what amino acid changed, we will have then been able to work out the genetic code. That was the dream. Now I have to say it never got done that way or just excepting one thing which... which came later and not by... so the idea was let's do chemical mutagenesis.
>
> We had all of these spectra, and the question was: what did these spectra mean? One remarkable thing is that the induced mutants were at different places from the spontaneous mutants, and what we knew was that the induced mutants could be made to revert by the same class of reagents that induced them but none of the spontaneous mutants could be made to revert by the so-called base analogue mutagens, and this was a great puzzle. So I thought we must go and do something completely different, so I said to Seymour, 'You know there this is dye **proflavine** which I've been interested in for many time – it combines with DNA and there's a paper by Bob DeMars'. Proflavine also interferes with phage assembly; we knew that as well.
>
> Now since there was a paper by Bob DeMars... he says he's made mutants with proflavine, so why don't we do an R2 spectrum? And Lesley Barnett started then to do this, started to make mutants with proflavine and started to map them and what do you know we found that none of these proflavine mutants could be induced to revert by base analogues and none of the base analogue mutants could be induced to revert by proflavine. So we had these two spectra and this proflavine, and this was very hard to explain and at the time we were exploring then other reagents. We made mutant spectra with hydrazine, with acid... with photodynamic inactivation. I remember I made mutants with acid, but just by treating them at pH4.5. You... you get the phage, we know that this pH bases are removed, they get depurinated and then from these you can get mutants.
>
> I then measured the pH of Coca-Cola and I discovered it's considerably lower than 4.5, so I thought of writing up a paper on acid mutagenesis, saying I had done this by putting bacteriophages in Coca-Cola and here we are we have these **Coca-Cola induced mutants** and sending it to the Coca-Cola company saying, 'I'm at a loss to know where to publish this, have you any useful suggestions?' Needless to say, we didn't do it, but of course it would be interesting today, and I'm jolly sure that Coca-Cola will induce mutants as well; I mean vinegar on chips, that's the worst thing you can do. However, this is... that's aside. So we did many of these things and at the same time we were working on this.

## 91. Purifying tRNA

> Now, furthermore, at the same time, Francis had decided that, 'We've got to start working on protein synthesis and what we've got to do is to start working on these Transfer RNAs'. So he started together with... with John Littlewood and Mahlon Hoagland who came here in that great glorious year to start to see whether they could purify transfer RNA, and start to work on protein synthesis; and so, you know, this was the whole thing: could we prove the adaptor hypothesis? Could we decode this way?
>
> So we had all of these experiments going on and we had this wonderful group in that year. Seymour, George, Mahlon Hoagland. Mahlon Hoagland's great... great accomplishment that year was to perform the guitar in the Green Man pub in Grantchester. They still remember him there because he stayed in the house next door which is Byron Lodge and he still remembers this as well to become that.
>
> And... and now of course there were competitors in this field. That is having formulated this... this program, many people said, 'We'll do this as well', and one of the ones was Cyrus Leventhal and decided he'd also do a gene protein problem and he would do it with a bacterial gene. So it'd become... that is, he would do it with alkaline phosphates; they could purify this, they could do this. There were other people working with bacteriophage and of course the... the other person who did it as well, later on, was Charles Yanofsky but Charles Yanofsky is a very interesting man in that he decided to work on tryptophan biosynthesis as a graduate student, starting with David Bonner, and he's just worked on that all of his life and fed into this whatever problems emerged.
>
> So he didn't start from this other end and that's different you see because we said, 'You have to get a system to prove this', and of course that I think is also very important and something which of course you learn, and something which I think is... is absolutely still important today and I'm still doing it which is that **once you've formulated a question, and if it's general enough, it means you can solve it in any biological system. So what you want to do is to find experimentally which is the best one to solve that problem** and as long as it's general enough you will find the solution there and **the choice of the experimental object remains one of the most important things to do in biology** and which sort of is, I think, one of the great places to do innovative work.

---

## 92. Purifying tRNA (Part 2)

> And so you have to say, 'Well, you know the diversity is so large...' We discussed bacterial protein research, cytochrome c discovery, and genetic pattern formation work. We worked with Fred Sanger's department exploring developmental genetics.

---

## 93. The first official use of Molecular Biology

> Now, at about this time, we had space problems in the Cavendish. A new professor had been appointed – that was Nevill Mott. It was very clear that with the crystallography developing then, because that's Max and John Kendrew had started to solve myoglobin and haemoglobin, that this unit – which had been called up to that point the unit for the Macro... the Molecular Structure of... of Biological Systems – that that couldn't last in the Cavendish, and that it would have to find some future home.
>
> And many things were explored. For example, at one time we explored the following possibility that the physicists – that is, the crystallography – would stay in the Cavendish, and that Francis and myself and our group, we would go to the genetics department, and Francis effectively applied for the Chair of Genetics here and was turned down. **Francis Crick was not thought to know anything about genetics**. Seymour tells a nice story about this as well when Fred Sanger came to Purdue University where Seymour was there to give his insulin lecture. Seymour came up to him and said, 'Oh you're... you come from Cambridge'. He said, 'Do you know Francis Crick?' To which Fred replied, **'Crick? Oh yes, he's the fellow who's rather keen on genes.'** But Francis was not thought to know anything about them even if he was keen on them to warrant being appointed a professor here.
>
> So we then explored possibilities of going into chemistry. That wouldn't work. Then the MRC said they'd make a building for us. We then tried to get a central site here because in those days in Cambridge you wanted to be in the centre, and it was a very active thing. People were in and out of each other's laboratories, the pubs around in this area were... you could always go in there and meet people from the Molteno Institute to the biochemistry department, so it was... it was like a... it was a real intellectual centre, but we could not actually survive here without getting some expansion.
>
> And so we tried to find a central site. I think one was found but it was discovered the land didn't belong to them and the university were not very interested in keeping us. And the MRC's first idea was they'll put all the MRC groups together and that will have taken us with certain people we didn't want to have and we told them no. What we think they ought to do is to do something in molecular biology. By this time, I think it was 1958 or 1959, **we had changed the name of our unit – we called it Molecular Biology**.

*[Q] From?*

> From the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems, and so **that is the kind of first official use of that word** although it had been used before as history has shown – Astbury... we used it some time ago – but in fact this science of molecular biology with its curious combination of chemistry, crystallography and genetics, you know, had been created at that point. And that's about the time the *Journal of Molecular Biology* got created and of course we were going to get this laboratory.

## 94. Genetics of the rII and the gene protein problem

> Well, during this period we were doing many things simultaneously, one of the things was the genetics of the R2; the other was trying to work on the gene protein problem. Now, the gene protein problem went ahead, and one of the things we discovered is that the protein that was very easy to purify in very large amounts was the head protein of the bacteriophage. **The amazing thing is that when one studied what happened after infection with this bacteriophage, this single protein accounted for 70% of all the protein synthesis of the cell**.
>
> Now, what you have to understand is that at that time it was believed that the ribosomes carried the information from the gene to the protein. That is the RNA of the ribosomes was the material that was so to speak the information intermediate. But already a lot of experiments seemed to make that very questionable.
>
> One of the experiments that created some concern was a whole set of analyses of the RNA of bacteria and of the DNA bacteria and it had been known for some time and strongly reinforced during this period that whereas the base composition – that is the amount of G + C to A + T – varied in bacteria over an enormous range. That is, they were bacteria whose DNA was 3/4 (G + C), down to bacteria whose DNA was 3/4 (A + T). That paradox was accompanied by a complete invariance of the RNA. The RNA seemed to have about the same base composition in all the bacteria.
>
> This gave rise to a lot of problems because, as you can see, if the DNA is supposed to carry the message, why did it vary so much? You would have thought that the language of the code was pretty invariant. Now there were two kinds of theories to get out of this. One was the DNA of bacteria was made up of two kinds. One was invariant and looked like the DNA—the composition of the RNA; and the other was variable, in fact it was just a lot of junk. Now **the Junk Hypothesis had to be discarded** when Doty and Sueoka showed that the dispersion of the DNA of this base composition was homogeneous.
>
> That is it was finely dispersed. They did this by measuring the density of the DNA and it's known that the density of G + C is different from the density of A + T. If the Junk Theory was correct you would have expected that DNAs from different bacteria would split into two fractions. One which corresponded to the bulk analysis, and then one smaller fraction which would have been the genes, and what they found is that the DNA base composition of the whole went down to rather small regions of DNA homogeneously.
>
> So that means that it was there, and of course this gave rise to the concept that in fact the code may be degenerate in some form. In fact Sinsheimer did make a suggestion of this, that essentially the code would have to be a pyrimidine purine code and not depend on which purine or this, so he did make a suggestion of a Binary Code. That of course is wrong, but I mean that is what we had to face. But what we could not explain is why is the base composition of the ribosomes invariant.

---

## 95. DNA and RNA synthesis

> So if you believe that... and with our work on... on bacteriophage, because of course we started to look at the head protein, and started to look for mutations controlling this, but this business of this prodigious synthesis was something that we knew had to be explained. Furthermore, it was known that after phage infection no bacterial proteins were made and so the phage then captured the bacteria for its own purposes.
>
> If you believe that the ribosomal RNA carried the information from gene to protein you would have to explain the rate by... by there being new ribosomes being made after phage infection. Since this occupied 70% of the protein synthesis for one protein, then at least an equal number of new phage ribosomes should have to be made. **The difficulty was that after phage infection no new ribosomes are made, there's no RNA synthesis**, and so what you had is if you wished to hold the old theory you had to have what I called at that time **the paradox of the prodigious rate of protein synthesis**. That is, you had to say, 'Well there could be a few new ribosomes made, they would have escaped your attention, but clearly these very few were capable of prodigious rates of function'.
>
> Well, people... other people were working on this question of RNA... of information transfer at the time and some years before two workers called Volkin and Astrachan had discovered a small fraction of RNA synthesis made after phage infection which had what is called the apparent base composition resembling that of the DNA.
>
> Now, the apparent base composition is done because when one hydrolyses RNA for its analysis you transfer the phosphate group from the group into... by which it entered the DNA into the adjacent neighbour. Therefore the apparent base composition would be the same as the real base composition if what we called the Digram Structure were random, that is any nucleotide could follow any other nucleotide on the average at... at the abundance they were in the... in the messenger.
>
> Volkin and Astrachan actually thought that this was an intermediate in DNA synthesis and **the mystery of Volkin-Astrachan DNA lingered on** there and of course you couldn't be too sure that there were a small fraction of cells that were doing this, that had escaped the block of phage synthesis.

---

## 96. François Jacob and Jacques Monod

> At the time then there was a... other people had begun to work on this RNA being made after phage infection and in fact there was a paper in which it had been suggested that this new RNA was in fact found in the presence of a small number of new ribosomes, and that got published later, and that everything was all right.
>
> Following... at the same time people working in Paris – this would be **François Jacob and Jacques Monod** – had come to realise that one could... one needed something special to explain enzyme induction. They had been studying the kinetics of enzyme induction after you add the gene to a cell and found that this happened extremely rapidly, and in fact by using various inhibitors they produced a number of alternatives, all of which just seemed quite strange.
>
> For example one of their alternatives was that the DNA for these enzymes made protein directly. There was no intermediate. But they were... they seemed to have excluded the possibility that new ribosomes were made to carry this, or if they were, they were a very small fraction and again capable of prodigious synthesis.

---

## 97. Volkin-Astrachan RNA and Phage

> I had got to meet François Jacob in the late '50s when I went to Paris to give a lecture on bacteriophage... We discussed the PaJaMo Experiment and the mystery of how information was transmitted from DNA to protein. This led us to thinking about messenger RNA.

---

## 98. Experimenting in California

> This meeting took place. By the afternoon François had come to my house in Cambridge, and we had designed the nature of the experiment that was later to be produced; that is, **we realise we have to show... have to show that this new RNA is on old ribosomes** and we... I realised very immediately that this could only be done on bacteriophage where we have the switch from old to new synthesis.
>
> And how would we tell the difference between old and new? Well, we would do it by the tricks developed by Meselson and Stahl which had... they'd developed for DNA. Namely we would label these with heavy isotopes – that is with Carbon 13, Nitrogen 15 – and we would be able by density gradient centrifugation just to weigh them and discover whether they were old or new, and that's one thing to say all of that and another thing to do it.
>
> Of course, the people who had all the amino acids made with the heavy isotopes were in California – that was Matt Meselson. I had learnt that François was going to go to California that summer, had been invited there, and what had happened was that I had been invited to come to California – another reason, and so we fixed it that we would go and do this experiment in California in... in the following June; it's a couple of months, and I fixed it with Matt Meselson we'd be able to use his isotopes and his equipment.

---

## 99. Experiments with 'Tape RNA'

> I then started to do some preliminary experiments here, and I did an experiment which was never published but in fact is quite an interesting experiment, because it proved that no new ribosomes could be made and this experiment which... which involves the following. If you take bacteria and starve them of magnesium, then after a long period of time – they remain viable – they lose their ribosomes and they destroy them and they turn them over, and that means that when you start 'em up again, by giving them a good medium, they have to take a long time to make new ribosomes to get going.
>
> So what I said, 'Well, I'll do a quickie'. That's an... that's an experiment which you'll see if you're on the right grounds because if it is true that new ribosomes are made after phage infection, my destroying the old ones wouldn't have any... any effect, and they should just take off and do the same thing. Was absolutely... the experiment was beautifully clear because the fewer the ribosomes that you have as they destroy... so you let... you destroy them, you then infect them at different periods, and you ask how much virus can you make, and it goes down, and it goes down, and there comes a point where you don't make anything because of course after phage infection you don't make any ribosomes. So that said... you know, then I knew I have to be right.
>
> And then we went to California to do this experiment and that was a hilarious story which has been told by François because you go to do quite a difficult experiment – I mean, it's technically quite complex – and I have to do it in three weeks, and I didn't even know whether it would work, even if we could get it to work. And one of the terrible things is that everything started to fall apart in the density gradient. The ribosomes were not stable and so every experiment failed. These experiments were awful; they took a lot of expensive isotope, and you didn't know the answer until you had run it in a centrifuge for a day, and of course if anything went wrong, if the centrifuge broke down, it was really terrible. So kind of getting this through to the end in an intact form was... was a thing, and every experiment we did didn't work, and I remember people saying, 'Well, you know, you're... it's going to take a year's work of exploratory, you know, normal science, to do this', and one of the amusing things was of course Max Delbrück didn't believe this hypothesis of the unstable intermediate.
>
> **We called it messenger RNA there, but we had another name for it; we called it Tape RNA** – it was called that for a short while – just being the idea that the ribosomes were like players, you know, like a tape player, and you fed them with tape. Actually, in my mind that was the old Turing machine you see. You fed a tape into this machine and it would play out its results, so it was called tape, and it was the whole idea of a message tape, and that of course strikes one now today as obvious that that would be the analogy. But then it was a very... you know, very dramatic thing, and Max Delbrück... I said to François... I said, 'You know we're fine'. He said, 'Why?' I said, **'Max doesn't believe in it'. Because Max was marvellous; he was always wrong**.
>
> There are marvellous stories told about Max. George Streisinger tells a story in his... in his essay on Max Delbrück that effectively he was met coming out of Max's office looking very depressed and someone said, 'What's the matter?' He says, **'Max likes my theory; it must be wrong'**. So the whole idea of doing... so I told François, 'Don't bother, Max thinks it's wrong, it must be right, you see', so we had a tremendous episode – this has been told – but one of the interesting things was where do you go from this?

## 100. Using magnesium to compete with caesium: radioactive Coca-Cola

> Some of the things I tried then were... were quite interesting, you see. For example, because the caesium chloride we were using to centrifuge these ribosomes was, what we say, 8 molal. That's almost like molar but not quite but you can imagine that it's 8 moles of the salt – that's very, very strong salt – and salt has to be soluble, and of course I discovered that there're bacteria that they'd got out of the Dead Sea that liked to live in 4 molar salt. So we think, why don't we try these, you know, because these will be ribosomes that like a lot of salt, so I actually got them you know, but of course we couldn't have done the experiment because they weren't sensitive to our bacteriophage, and in the end one had to do it with this.
>
> And the dramatic thing which is recounted is just lying on a beach there because we had gone out to the beach to kind of rest our weary souls; this was the last chance and I had felt... we felt it's all over, you know – we now have to settle down to a year of really boring analysis and conditions and so on; and then it occurred to me that of course, you see, **it is magnesium that stabilises this, and the caesium will compete with the magnesium** – not very efficiently, but enough to displace it and unstabilise it. And of course the magnesium we were putting in was a thousandth molar, the caesium we had was 8 molar; therefore the thing to do is to raise the magnesium.
>
> And of course I didn't give this argument but as recounted I sprang up and said, 'It's the magnesium, it's the magnesium', and of course, you know, François didn't know what was going on, but he went, and of course we ran back to the lab and we raised the magnesium. We said, 'How much?' I said, 'Let's do a lot', you know because you have three tubes and we said this is the last chance. So I said, 'Put in a lot, can do no harm'. So he said, 'Hundredth molar?' I said, 'All right but let's have one with tenth molar in, you know, we'll just go another 10'.
>
> So we put this in; we set up the experiment. François was so nervous he dropped the radioactive P-32 in the water-bath, and we hid the water-bath behind the Coca-Cola machine so that they couldn't find it because it was now very radioactive. In fact, I did come up... I then came several years later to Cal Tech, and I said, 'Could I have a Coke please?' And they said, 'Oh yes'. I said, 'Is the machine still in the basement?' I wanted to see if this water bath was still there. It wasn't there, but, you know, clearly it... it was safe after a few months.

## 101. Using magnesium to compete with caesium: the experiment

> The centrifuge had a malfunction during a crucial gradient run, requiring careful transfer between cold rooms. I recall the meticulous manual process of extracting drops from tubes using a needle. I carried the rotor through Cal Tech's cooled hallways, becoming drenched from water condensation. François Jacob observed nervously as I pierced the tubes, with the first drop slightly compromised.
>
> The memorable aspect: **this experiment concluded the evening Kennedy received the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1960**. François and I monitored our counter in the basement laboratory, watching results accumulate. As numbers rose, we cheered: "Ascendez, ascendez, you see it's rising," later urging "Go down, go down, down, down."
>
> The results proved convincing. I subsequently conducted validation work in Cambridge during late 1960, and we submitted our paper to *Nature* before year-end. James Watson submitted related messenger RNA work, causing a five-month publication delay until May 1961.
>
> The paper proposed three theoretical models explaining information transfer between DNA and protein production, then systematically tested predictions against our experimental findings.

## 102. Still working on mutagenesis

> Now at the same time, we were working still on mutagenesis, so you have to imagine that one went from one thing to the other. We were doing... we were doing the whole project, it all had a whole... though today you would say, 'Well, what are you doing density gradient with the one hand and genetics with the other?' But it had this... it had this whole, because what we were interested in was what is the connection between what's written in the DNA and what's written in the protein. That's all we wanted to know and we would use any... we would use anything... any method to try to get to that root. Now the mutagenesis thing which was going on simultaneously is quite... is interesting in the sense that at one point Francis decided that he would start to do genetics.

---

## 103. Acceptance of the paper

*[Q] Sydney, just why did you wait for Watson's paper?*

> Well, we gathered from communication with Matt Meselson that it was a matter of weeks that they would produce their results. We knew they didn't... they hadn't done the sort of experiments that we had done, because **what we had decided to go for was a really definitive one which would demonstrate that new RNA was added to old ribosomes**.
>
> And their experiments involved in showing there was an RNA fraction that was on ribosomes. They did this by a sucrose gradient technique. As it happened our paper sat around for a few months, because I think... and... but it doesn't matter.
>
> As far as we're concerned, it was I think the experiment had its own intrinsic value, and in fact what to me, you know, was not reproduced by the Watson was in fact the... the logical depth of our argument.
>
> And now that seems ridiculous that we would try to exclude, you know, other models. And in fact, as I recall, you know, this kind of style of saying, 'We propose three models', you know, and this I... later on in... in life, someone got up at a meeting and said, 'I wish to propose two models: model A and model B.'
>
> And he said... 'Well,' he said, 'either model A is right or model B is right.' And I said, 'You've forgotten there's a third alternative'. He said, 'What's that?' I said, **'Both could be wrong'**, you see. So we thought we had done the exhaustive enumeration of the current possibilities. But of course that experiment came at the right time.

*[Q] Was it accepted at once?*

> Oh, yes. I know that Arthur Kornberg did not like to accept it. Soon after giving this... doing this work at Cal Tech, I went up to Stanford to give a lecture and I received a long lecture, a fatherly lecture, from Arthur Kornberg – which irritated me, I have to say – telling me I didn't understand intermediary metabolism.
>
> And I can remember being quite annoyed and giving him, you know, the kind of child's four year old explanation, or the explanation for four year olds of the difference between the apparent and the true base composition which does not depend on pools.
>
> You see, most biochemists said, 'Well, this could be affected by the pool size and the labelling of it by the tracer'. But you can show that it isn't. The only thing that can affect it is if it isn't random. And that's an assumption which we said, but pool size doesn't matter at all, so...
>
> However, it did take a lot of time to jar people out of this, and also to jar them out of the idea that you could actually do an experiment like this and take it as evidence. You know, you could actually say, 'Look, these are old ribosomes', and... and get people to accept the... the actual style of the experiment.
>
> See, that's another... it's very popular these days to have an experiment done in a certain style and then every paper has to be written in that style and you aren't allowed to publish a paper until you've fulfilled this. So there was a time that unless you had a sucrose gradient of something, you couldn't publish a paper.
>
> There was another time that you had to show a heteroduplex in an electron microscope and if you didn't have this... you know, I thought one day that I would make one of these things out of rope on a beach and just photograph it and just say, 'I've done the heteroduplex – there it is'.
>
> But I find that this is... this is the thing. So nobody had ever done a paper which involved, you know, isotope 13C and 15N in this form. And I think at those days that... that got into *Nature* and specified what it was.

## 104. François Jacob and genetics

*[Q] Are we going to talk about Jacob for a moment?*

> Yeah, well I think the... François was of course extremely pleased with this, because this wasn't in the sort of thing that they were doing. And yet to have brought this from another direction and, you know, really reinforce the ideas they had, that in fact... you know, what regulation was involved – because that was what they were interested in – was in fact turning on gene expression.

*[Q] François was a geneticist, he...*

> François was a geneticist, he was not a... a biochemist in that sense. He had done... he... he had come from lambda where all of these concepts were developed about repression. And of course in Paris the main thing was this lysogeny work. It had come from the... from a different tradition. And I think in the West and under the influence of Max Delbrück the... the lambdoid phages – that is, the temperate phages – were seen as a bit deviant, and the real thing was bacteriophage T4 and what that did. But the lambda work had developed the whole concept of the phage repressor, which was then used... which was then used by Jacob and Monod to generalise the idea. And so they were always looking at this from a regulatory point of view, and it was in fact the beta-galactosidase system of bacterial enzymes of utilisation of lactose that became in fact the... the paradigm that was studied. And so François was of course interested in this, and in fact one of the things we did after the messenger experiments was to go together and do some studies of the genetics of the galactose operon, which we published in *Comptes Rendus*, about this time in '62.

## 105. The curtain opens: the importance of conversation

> I certainly know at... for my own, since I believe I was... I was the first to have the curtain drawn, at least that's how it seemed to me. That for me, I... suddenly the curtain got opened and I could see it all. And certainly I don't think I would have been led to think about that funny connection; you see, the thing is this: you talk about phage T4, you get all involved in the intricacies of this, and if you talk about two things simultaneously, so, you know, you have a lot of green balls bouncing and you have a lot of red balls bouncing, then sometimes you can just see one set of balls bouncing the same way. And I think that is so necessary to continue, you know, almost hysterical conversation, just constitutive talking, because I think that **brings things together that you don't actually see by... logical deduction**, because most logical deduction you just go around in the same circle and you need to break out of it.
>
> And of course the messenger RNA, as defined in bacteria, was unstable. Now, there was another sense in which one could think of it, and that is the following. A Turing machine is like a... a kind of a model of a calculating machine in which you have a table that stores information, and a table could be thought of as a piece of tape, and you have another piece of tape on which there are instructions, programs, that say how to go to the tape, what to do when you get to the tape, whether you should put a 0 or a 1 down; and there's one version of the Turing machine which has the instructions on the same tape. And when von Neumann came to look at how cells reproduced themselves, he showed that as far as the automata theory was concerned you needed the description. That is, you couldn't build a machine that could replicate from its own structure; you would require a description of that structure, and you would use the description and you would copy the description and then the new machine with the new description is as good as the old. Okay? And the first thought was, you know, can you dissociate the two of these: this tape recorder – and you can use the tape recorder analogy – in a tape recorder there's a tape, and there's the machinery for reading or writing, and there's an amplifier, right – can we separate these? And in fact the messenger was just an abstraction. It wasn't in the mRNA; it was a concept. Namely that **you could make a machine in which the instructions were separate from the machine**, and that's really what the messenger... I mean, of course it got called messenger RNA.
>
> And at this meeting at Cold Spring Harbor in 1961, in fact one thing that we discussed was what do we name this thing? And we thought **messenger** was a perfectly good word for it – I don't know who suggested it – but I do recall that Erwin Chargaff immediately said, 'You know, of course, **Mercury may have been the messenger of the gods, but he was also the god of the thieves**'. And I think it's right to steal from nature.

## 106. Internal suppressors: the Theory of Mutagenesis

> Of course, at the same time we were doing all of this genetic work and round about then we... Francis had started to play around in the lab with mutants. And his idea was he would look at internal suppressors of these mutants. Now, for example, one thing he proposed to test by this method was the following: that the message was read off the DNA as follows, it went up one chain and then came down the other chain, you see. That would mean, if you got a mutation, it would affect a protein here – OK – but you could compensate for it by mutation in a completely different place. So he was trying to ask whether there was some kind of interaction.
>
> And his first mutants didn't give him much joy; he started with a few of the base analogue ones. By the way, Dick Feynman started to do similar experiments in Cal Tech, looking for these internal suppressors and probably discovered the same phenomena. Now, where Francis found there were innumerable suppressors was with the acriflavine mutants. So you could start with a mutant, you could get changes that compensated for it, right, and this became now very difficult to explain all this very complex set of relationships, by something that interacted at the protein level – although you couldn't exclude it, say.
>
> We all knew that it was possible to get a mutation here which would alter a protein and then we would get another mutation elsewhere which corrects it. It's called an internal suppressor. But not with a kind of extent. Now, we also were labouring under this terrible... paradox, and it's always these paradox that, you know, you... you have to keep on coming back... how can... how can these two things exist and not be explained, you know? And of course we all know what I call **Occam's Broom hypothesis, or Occam's Brush in America, which is that hypothesis of which the minimum number of facts have to be swept up under the carpet in order to have a consistent theory**.
>
> Now, what had happened was that Freese, or Freese I should call him, had given an explanation which was roughly the following: In the DNA we can look at two kinds of changes. One of these we'll call transitions; and that is where we say a purine... one purine goes to the other purine, or, which is equivalent, one pyrimidine goes to the other pyrimidine. So cytosine to thymine is a transition, as is guanine to adenine. And then we talk about transversions, where a purine goes to a pyrimidine, and of course there are two kinds of... several kinds of transversions.
>
> Well, what Freese had come to the conclusion was the two orthogonal sets of mutants – that is, the set of base analogue mutants which were revertible by base analogues, and the set of now acridine mutants which were not – that one could be transversions and one could be transitions. Right. That was that theory of mutagenesis, as it was called. But if that were the case, you know, we had another paradox all mapped at the same... all mapped at different positions, and you would effectively expect this.

---

## 107. Another hypothesis: base additions and deletions

> Talking in the Eagle one time, I knew that proflavine... because of my long interest in these damn acridine dyes and their attachment to DNA and all the measurements that had been made in the early '50s by people, though I began to wonder whether in fact there was not another hypothesis. And in fact by some very tortuous reasoning which of course clarified the moment one said it, I said that, **'What would it be like if there were not only base substitutions but base additions and deletions?'**
>
> And I suddenly realised that you could get that if you stuck proflavine into the DNA, right, or if it went between the base pairs as people did it – intercalation – and you could have a thing where the DNA thought it... this was another base and stuck an extra one in, okay, or it thought on the other side, if it was copying the other strand and made a deletion – that there was a base running free. So the whole idea then came of some connection between additions and deletions, all right? And this then said of course that acridine mutants would have a drastic effect.

---

## 108. Sense and nonsense: the Commaless Code

> What we'd become preoccupied by was the business of mis-sense and non-sense. I mean, sense and nonsense. A very brilliant theory had been produced by Griffith, Crick and Orgel, called **the commaless code**. Now, the commaless code is very interesting. What you do is you take triplets and you say that, 'Can you find a sequence of triplets which can only be read in one frame, so that every other frame is nonsense?' And you can. And you can prove it gives you exactly 20 again. And this again the magic number comes out. So you can write codes called comma-less codes, where in one frame it makes sense, and every other frame it makes nonsense. And so that gives you 20 sense triplets and 44 mis-sense triplets.
>
> And so one of the things we wanted to know was: how frequently is there nonsense in the code? Because, clearly, if a lot of triplets correspond to no nonsense, you should have very high targets for destroying the meaning of a message. You know, most of the mutations should give you nonsense. And certainly... so... but we needed to get away, and so there was the other thing which was called the... which I called **the Humpty Dumpty model**, which was: how do you get the phase of a message? You start at the beginning and read on in threes till you come to the end; if you remember, that's what Humpty Dumpty tells Alice about how to tell the story and so on.
>
> And that model then said that if you changed the phase by adding bases or taking out bases you make a mess of the rest of it. All right? And now putting all of those things together made sense. And so we did a very quick experiment which was formulated on that Saturday afternoon; the experiment was actually done on the Monday. What we realised was there are some proteins which are necessary for the phage. These are these host range mutants. And so what we showed, very quickly, was one: all the existing host range mutants were base analogue revertible. Spontaneous host range mutants were base analogue revertible. And that contrasted with the fact that 90% of the spontaneous mutants in the R2 were not base analogue revertible.
>
> And furthermore: we showed we could induce those mutants with base analogues, but we could not induce them with acridines. And we wrote a paper entitled *The Theory of Mutagenesis*, in which we proposed that there were substitution mutants, for which those were all the ones, and that there were additions and deletions. These were the acridine mutants, producing this drastic effect – and of course now that combined with all these other experiments now made sense.

---

## 109. Using frame-shift to determine the size of the genetic code

> The acridine experiments went on, and they made various interesting predictions. So just to give you an example, you could start with a mutant which you arbitrarily labelled 'plus', then all the suppressors of it would be ones that would be minuses. So when you add a plus and a minus you come back to zero again. Now, I have to say that this concept of a frame or a phase – we called it phase-shift, it turned to be frame-shift later on – was so foreign to people in genetics that we had endless problems trying to explain this work to people, right?
>
> And so just going on with this... so now... now you can go... you can start with a suppresser, and it must be symmetrical. So if you start with a minus suppresser, then its suppressors must be plus. And so you then can create arrays of, as they were called, uncles and aunts, cousins, brothers, sisters, and you can see how they relate and you can map them and you can do this. It soon... it became very clear to us very quickly that **we could use this to determine the size of the code**. All we had to ask is how many of these could we put together and so come back to the normal phase, because you see according to this, two pluses would be a minus if it was a triplet phase.
>
> And so the question was: how do you do this experiment uniquely? And the experiment had to be done uniquely in the following way. You make doubles... you make doubles by brute force. So we take, say, three mutants, A, B, C, in a row, and we make a combination A and B. And A and B is mutant, and we make the combination B and C, and B plus C is mutant. Now, we cross those phages together, there is no way a normal phage can be produced, because they both share B. But of course you get wild-type functional phage come out, and that must be the triple: A, B, C. So we showed we could actually construct a triple, and therefore **the triple showed that the code was phase three**.
>
> Now, this I think is the kind of apotheosis of a genetic analysis, because you have to consider what you're doing here. You're taking these viruses and you are just mixing them together and you're simply recording plus, minus. And from this pattern it seems mad that you could deduce the actual triplet nature of the genetic code. But that's just simply the logic of how the information is transferred, that it is a non-overlapping code of these, and of course awoke us, well at least awoke me, to the idea that **topology could, you could do these things at the kind of topological level**.
>
> And so let me just say that to the geneticist this was very hard to stomach. You could take a mutant – you could a set of mutants and you can show first, you could add them in certain pairs, they were still mutant. Other pairs, you just restored the function. Furthermore, you could take these, pair them in many ways, they were still mutant, but if you put three together they came back to normal. And if you did four, five, they were still mutant, then we went as far as six to make it normal, and then after that it got a bit boring.
>
> And **formally what we showed that the code is a multiple of three. It's 3n bases, where n is likely to be 1**. And that was deduced completely by this experiment.

---

## 110. Exceptions to the frame-shift rules

> I have to tell you that there were many exceptions. There were some things that didn't obey these rules. And the question is: you can ask whether in science you should at least tell people about this. So you... what we had was a huge body of information which was entirely self-consistent and of course with a concept of the barriers, that as certain frame-shifts generated mutants themselves and therefore were not compatible. We had that all worked out at the time, fortunately, otherwise it wouldn't have made sense. And the question is: what happens to all these exceptions? So you have the **Don't Worry hypothesis**: there... there'll be an explanation for them.
>
> As it turned out it took about five more years to work through all the exceptions, and the remarkable thing is that **each one of them had a different and special explanation**. Some of them were very remarkable. For example, there was one mutant which appeared to suppress itself. We could never isolate a suppresser. And it turned out that what that mutant did was duplicate itself, and in the duplication – that is, the junction of the duplication – introduced the third phase shift. So you had plus, you had a junction point which was plus, and then you had the mutant again which was plus. And of course... so we proved this by showing that the mutant mapped on both sides of itself. That was what... as a completely different explanation.
>
> Another set of mutants, we made a strong prediction that no base analogue mutants should be revertible by acriflavine. We found some. And vice versa. It turned out that those were due to new start signals being produced. And so when you get something like this, it tells you that **all the exceptions, each of which cannot be explained by the coherent theory... that the coherent theory remains, then. And it is... was wise to take all of these exceptions which showed no relationship amongst each other and put them on one... we didn't conceal them; we put them in an appendix**.

---

## 111. A completely interlocking theory

> It was **the real house of cards theory**; you had to buy everything – that is, you couldn't take one fact and let it stand on itself and say the rest could go. Everything was so interlocked. You had to buy the plus minuses, you had to buy the barriers, you had to buy the triplets phase, and all of those remained together. And it was the whole that explained the thing. And if you attacked any one part of it, the whole thing fell apart. So it was **all or nothing theory**; it was very interesting because of the coherent thing.
>
> And very hard to communicate to people who just thought, you know, this is just, it can't be done this way. However, I think that that is one of the most beautiful... I mean, **aesthetically elegant experiences of my life**, in which, just by doing these little operations, you land up with this detailed description of the molecular structure of living matter. And all of those things happening at the same time – this in 1960 to 1961.

---

## 112. Lab space

> By this time Francis had become extremely skilled at exacting space from various departments. Our phage lab was in the old museum in... in zoology, which had a whale in it at one time. We borrowed the space from the professor of zoology. It was a wonderful lab, because it had... it was just a... like a corridor with a row of windows, and all the people you could be... it was a lab that always loved because I'm a... I'm a mad hatter in the sense of what I like is to have a bench and then I make... do an experiment here, and then move on to the next place, do another experiment and have someone clean it up behind me – just circulate.
>
> What was so interesting is that we had a lot of people working with us and we used to watch the people walking by, you know, and you could say to people, 'Oh, you see... you see that man, that's Professor Dirac, you see'. Once there was in the... there was a restaurant here at the Friar House, because this is a... this is another uncanny feeling of being in this part, and we looked in and there was a tea room and there was a man sitting there with a elderly lady, and I said to this friend... I said, 'Just have a look in that room, in... in the tea room; there are two people who changed the world'. Who was it? It was Otto Frisch and his aunt, Lise Meitner, sitting there.

## 113. Experimenting with adding messengers to ribosomes

> With these developments, both showing that the triplet code and also with a concept of messenger, it became obvious to both ourselves and to many other people that we could now add messengers to ribosomes and should in fact get them to produce something, but so naïve... And we started experiments here in Cambridge – I had a postdoc who came – and **our idea was to add viral RNAs to E. coli ribosomes because we thought you should be able to play any tape**, and we know that these virus RNAs have information; because they are the genetic information, we could get them in high amounts.
>
> And so we started with turnip yellow mosaic virus, trying to add it to E. coli ribosomes and trying in an in vitro synthetic system to try to get some protein made, and then our aim was: we'll show them that that's the viral protein. Now when I gave my paper at Cold Spring... at Cold Spring Harbor in '61 – summer of '61 – the people from Ochoa's lab heard this and realised that you could add things to ribosomes. And so they also began adding RNAs to this, and so did Marshall Nirenberg begin by doing this... did this as well. And he started to work with tobacco mosaic virus, trying to add it to E. coli ribosomes.
>
> Now, of course we know now you won't get anything because these are eukaryotic messengers they require a whole set of factors which are not present in bacteria. The story of adding the... which Ochoa and also Nirenberg did, of adding synthetic polymers, which was the first breakthrough in decoding this. This has various forms. The Ochoa group has claimed they... they realised they could just add this and have a... have a go. They didn't know much about initiation factors and that was good, **that's where ignorance triumphed**.
>
> And Nirenberg, the story goes, was working with TMV and it was suggested that he use a synthetic polymer as a control to get nothing, you see, because a synthetic polymer of Us would be... would be meaningless. And of course this is where he got a lot of incorporation of phenylalanine. And so a lot of people then began by this and then later by binding experiments, and then Khorana who did a lot of work on this by looking at repeating polymers, so all of that work finally led to the definition of the genetic code by direct analysis through RNAs and ribosomes.
>
> But I think that those experiments were conceptually implausible until the concept of messenger. No one would have tried it, because you'd have thought: I have to open the ribosome, take out what's there and stick in my thing. And so I think that that was... that was the thing. And indeed, the people in Ochoa's lab said that's what... said that they... they thought that they can do it.

## 114. The state of biochemistry in Britain

> One of the things that I think was... was bad in... in Britain at the time was our very poor abilities in this kind of biochemistry. All the biochemistry was still very old fashioned, I mean, whereas in America the... the people emerging from the laboratories of Ochoa, from Kornberg... had by this time, you know, the huge armoury of materials. You see, Kornberg had a monopoly, well, you know, I don't want to put it like that, but really he had a monopoly of DNA replication because he was the only person who had radioactive triphosphates. And in fact in the Kornberg-Berg Lab, when a student came in, his first job was to make materials for the research, either prepare an enzyme... so the kind of strategic aspect... I mean, today you just phone up a company and buy it, but in those days getting into the technology and getting that tradition, working on protein synthesis, DNA replication, all of the messenger; there was hardly of this in Europe. And it was something that was very poor. And we realised, you know, coming as we did, that we would have to do some of this. So I think it was effectively, you know, the combination of not being able to get into that fast enough, and in fact we resolved thereafter that we would have... we would develop this biochemistry. I mean, Francis was always very keen to do this, but we didn't have the resources in the Cavendish. But when we moved to the new building we built up a lot of this biochemistry capability. But at the time, you know, we could do things, and in a way it was very good, because doing it by biochemistry just seemed awfully brute force. And since I think you had come... we had come to the position of being... prizing ingenuity beyond anything else, and elegance in the sense of being able just to sort of toss it away and do an experiment and say something profound from it – although I think that was more, you know, that was more a put on than reality, in other words a bit exaggerated – but I think that **the lack of that kind of impetus, that kind of school of biochemistry, really held things back here**.

## 115. 1962: a new lab and a new way of working

> In 1962 we moved to the new lab, where in fact we... these... many of these continued, mostly work on suppression, because the simplest idea of genetic suppression was that they were mutations of transfer RNA. So instead of a transfer RNA reading UA... reading for UAC, it could read UAG, because it had a mutation. And so the genetic and structural analyses of those occupied quite a lot of... of our activity.
>
> But I think already in this field, the... the whole sort of drama of doing it by genetics alone had disappeared, the whole of the analysis, and so **this is when one began to turn one's... one's mind to higher things, or to other things at the time**.

## 116. The importance of understanding molecular structure (Part 1)

> The importance I think is the following. **If you take the extreme view that what you'd like to do is to compute organisms from their genome, then you have to understand inside an organism what one can call the... the principle of construction**. Let me give you an example, which is the following: we can look at the head of a virus and we can see it's a perfect icosahedron, right. So... and we know that's genetically determined, because that's inherited. So what we want to know is **how is the equation for an icosahedron written in DNA**.
>
> Now, many people... we know how the equation for some icosahedron is written, let us say, on the back of cornflakes packages. What you have is you have this and it says cut here, bend here, glue here, and you can fold it all up and make this box. But that's not the way it is done. So what you have to understand is how icosahedra are made. They're not made out of sheets of cardboard inside a cell. What they're made out of is molecules of proteins packing together. And that means that they have certain contacts which have certain angles and those angles are characteristic of the icosahedron. Or the dodecahedron, or whatever it is.
>
> Now, if you ask how is that angle established, that angle is established because that protein has folded up and displays on its surface a little patch which is able to act, interact with a symmetrical patch on itself, such that they clamp together as a dimer or a trimer or as a pentamer as the case may be. Thus if we were to unravel all of the structure what we will find is that **the equation for an icosahedron is written in little bits and pieces in the genome, in a little sequence of amino acids here, and another little bit there**. And we could not disentangle that a priori unless we understood the principle of construction.
>
> So the importance of doing molecular structure and of looking at this is to grasp how this is in fact will be encoded in the genome. And to understand that it has enough to have this so you can build virus heads or build organelles or build ribosomes or build membranes or build complexes of any kind like this, because **it's all to do with a process of self-assembly**.

---

## 117. The importance of understanding molecular structure (Part 2)

> It gives a lot of people, I should say, a problem. Because when you think about it in even a larger scale, and if you say, 'Well, the behaviour of an organism is specified in the genome; of course we want to... we want to know the whole principle of construction in between'. So when someone says that those little ducks that follow Lorenz around are programmed to follow him around, I mean, we don't think in the DNA it says follow Dr Lorenz around. So what you have to do is you have to have the genes, the genes then have to work in cells, the cells then have to build a nervous system, the nervous system has to have certain capacities for learning, and that's the way the genes specify: follow Dr Lorenz around. So the argument is very clear; **you have to open the box. It is not an input/output system**, because what's in the box can actually determine your theory of how this can work. And I think this is so important in biology and many people think you've got to get your hands on the meat as well as the... as well as, you know, the... the generalisation, and I think that's true; because after all, what we're trying to explain is a very complicated thing. We have a genome here. It's just this very simple array of bases. We have at the other end of it the most elaborate structures, the most... the most bizarre functions of anything, right. We also have a theory that says you can make changes in this and you can affect what it looks like at the other end, and your sense tells you. I don't believe that, because usually if you have something as complicated as this and you make a change in it you just mess it up completely. So we have to have what I call **the grammar of the system**. Part of how you build it up, you construct it, you develop it, is part of that grammar. And unless you include that in the explanation it can't make sense. Hence I think **structure at all levels is important**.
>
> Francis has a very good statement, he says, 'Function is terribly hard to investigate, so when you can't study function you do the next best thing, which is to study structure'. And I think that this was important although the exact intellectual connection between structural people and people interested in what we were interested in, which is information, and how the information gets out of the genes and how it is used to... to specify all of this, that wasn't as tight a question as it is, because I think that for a long time, even today, structure has been dominated by technical... technical peaks that had to be climbed. And technical accomplishment became very important, so, you know, if you did a molecule of 17,000, then the next time you went on to one of 30,000 – you know, which was eight times as difficult – so that you could expand the boundaries of this. It's... it's to me a most remarkable fact that **the only person that really understands the structure of anything is the person who did that structure**. So if you want to find out about haemoglobin go and talk to Max. Because Max is the only person who really understands haemoglobin. And so I think that... that is now one of the things that this... however, I have to say that it was this genetics, which is I think what we were interested in – and it was protein chemistry, which was what Fred Sanger was interested, together with the structural thing that... that really when put together was all of the future of molecular biology, because what we had were the molecules of information and the molecules of function.

## 118. Looking for a new subject and inventing names

> 1961 was of course a very exciting year. During that year we published two papers. One was on the messenger RNA experiments, and the other was on the general nature of the genetic code. Of course, that was incredibly exciting, but there was still a lot more work to do in order to follow these things up. But already I think in 1962, my interests were already turning to different matters. And during that year Francis Crick and I began a long series of conversations, which we continued over several years, which is: **what should we do next?**
>
> It seemed, as it does happen in all science, that when one gets to this stage there seem to be only what the military people call mopping up operations. And of course such was the thrill of doing molecular biology that one didn't want to be involved in that, and one would rather go forward to fresh pastures.
>
> I had during 1961, had a number of discussions with François Jacob – who was... who did the messenger RNA experiments with me – about DNA replication. And we did some experiments together in early 1962 which tried to test the model that we proposed. This was called the replicon.
>
> In those days everybody defined a unit in the same way physicists defined units, and the first person to do that was Seymour Benzer. Seymour Benzer defined three units: the **cistron**, which was the unit of complementation; the **muton**, which was the unit of mutation; and the **recon**, which was the unit of recombination. And of course only one of those has survived, the cistron, and the reason the other two didn't survive was that **one should always see what one's units sound like in a different language**. And since we had numerous French colleagues, the other two didn't survive because one sounded like a sheep, and the other one sounded like the things Paris taxi drivers call each other. So those two got eliminated.
>
> Some... a short while thereafter, and I think it was 1957 or 1958, I invented the word **codon**, which was... which has also survived. And that was a word to describe the... the units that would be... would be... specify the amino acids, which of course we used that because we didn't know at the time that they were triplets. We thought they might be.
>
> And so in due course we had the **operon** which is... Jacob and Monod used for the... for the unit of genetic expression in bacteria. That is the unit that was regulated, and that survived, in fact one often thought of giving lectures entitled 'A Night at the Operon'. And the word that François and I invented for the unit of replication was of course the **replicon**, and the replicon has survived as well.

## 119. DNA replication

> DNA replication was in the hands of the biochemists, and they thought it was very straightforward, you just have an enzyme called DNA polymerase, which Arthur Kornberg had worked on and discovered, and you had DNA and you gave it some substrates and so you had the equation DNA plus DNA polymerase plus four triphosphates gives you more DNA. And that was the end of the story as far as the biochemists were concerned.
>
> But we were interested in... not in just copying DNA, but how this DNA would be segregated, given to daughter cells. Would you have to copy the DNA from many sites, which is what the biochemists had at least a picture of? And how would you regulate this? Because a bacterial cell copies DNA exactly once; takes the daughters, and segregates them to different cells.
>
> So our idea was that **DNA replication started at one place**. So that we had an element which later became the origin of replication. And that there was what we called positive regulation. Namely something had to appear which said start here and go on doing it.
>
> Now, the concept then was that it wouldn't matter about what DNA was attached to that unit, it would be just copied. As you... as you can see that later that became the whole basis of genetic engineering, because if a bacterial DNA could, so to speak, identify its own DNA as opposed to anything else you put into it, then that would have made all of this impossible, but we took the view **DNA is DNA, it's just bases**, and if you attach it to the right replication unit, then it will be copied willy-nilly and wouldn't require subsequent elements within it. And we proposed to test our hypothesis of positive regulation by a whole series of experiments, of which the very first one worked.

---

## 120. DNA replication: the first experiment

> Our very first one was very simple. Bacteria had elements called F elements. These F elements could transfer themselves by so-called process of conjugation from one bacterium to another. That was work that had done by Bill Hayes and of course extensively by Jacob and Wollman in their study of bacterial conjugation, and they proved that the chromosome – when it was attached to an F element in the so-called Hfr strains, high frequency of recombination – were transferred from one point in one given direction, and progressively, so that it would take about two hours, 120 minutes, to transfer the whole chromosome. And we thought that the good driving force for this – this was the replicon idea – was of course replication itself. So our idea was that a bacterial cell carrying an F element had two replicons: its own and one of the F element. The F element was a rather special one in that it started from a point of origin and then by replication it would drive the chromosome across the cell, because you can either think of the DNA polymerase sitting in one place... you can either think of the DNA polymerase moving along the DNA, but if you were to nail it down what would happen is the DNA would pass through it. Which is of course a much better picture of what's going on. And if it did this it would transfer a daughter chromosome.
>
> Now, what we knew is that acridine orange cured F factors. That is, if you grew cells carrying F factors in acridine orange they lost them. We therefore argued for some reason or another the F factor was sensitive, its replication was sensitive to this dye, acridine orange. Therefore, we said, if transfer was due to the same replication experiment we should be able to stop transfer by acridine orange. However, there was no sign that acridine orange actually inhibited replication, and so our argument was that once it got started you couldn't stop it with acridine orange. You could only stop its initiation. And of course we did the experiments, they were very simple to do and they worked immediately.
>
> Well, François and I discussed this is the... in spring of 1962, we discussed this at a meeting at Royaumont and we both went home and we both did the experiment the next day and we phoned each other up to tell us, to tell each other that we'd got the same results. So we then proceeded to do more experiments, and in fact we planned a rather complicated experiment and... but decided that since the theory was so good we would write it up in advance. And we went on a combined family holiday to a French seaside resort called La Tranche which we used to... we still do refer to as **Zee Slice**, in the Vendée, and we spent hours on the beach sort of telling children not to pester us, and in that we developed the whole idea of the replicon. Which we published later that year in the *Comptes Rendus* and that was the theory of... and we proceeded then to do a number of experiments to test it.

## 121. Issues of the organisation of DNA replication in a bacterial cell

> One of the important experiments which was very tricky to do was of course to show – in addition to all the things we had done with F factors – that it... that the DNA transferred from the male into the female bacterium was of course one-time replicated. This we proposed to do by a Meselson-Stahl experiments. Meselson and Stahl had labelled DNA with heavy atoms, nitrogen and carbon. And they had shown then that DNA replicated semi-conservatively – that is, the daughter molecules had one old strand, for example, light, and the new, and the new molecules had a heavy strand.
>
> So we proposed to use this. This was extremely difficult experiment to do at the time, because you had to have many labels radioactive to mark the parental DNA. It had to be done... we had to make sure that we destroyed all unconjugated cells, and that we only retrieved DNA from the cells. And eventually they were such a minority of the population. However, the experiment was done and in fact did show that the DNA that came across was indeed a hybrid DNA, had been replicated once.
>
> One of the other features of, of our experiment was that in somehow the DNA had to be attached to some part of the cell, and in bacteria that have no nucleus, no nuclear membrane, this DNA had to be attached to the cell membrane. And the idea was that if it was attached at a given point, which is another part, only one point would be required for the attachment, then when it copied, the new copy would be attached, remain attached by one strand. And then the idea was you would grow the membrane in between the two copies and that's the way they segregated to opposite cells.
>
> I have to say that in doing this work there, I had an echo of something I had done ten years previously, or more, in South Africa, where I had been using little pieces of liver in a Beams and King turbine ultracentrifuge, an air turbine which I'd built myself. And I noticed in centrifuging these cells and cutting sections of them, that the... that the DNA, or as we called it then, chromatin, had not sedimented completely to the bottom of the nucleus, but seemed to be connected to the top of it by strands. And in fact I was so impressed by this that I thought that that proved that, that the chromosomes were still attached to the nuclear membrane. And I wrote a paper on this which was published in *Experimental Cell Research* in 1953, called *The Chromatic Nuclear Membrane*, which was the result of that experiment and which showed DNA attached to this. And of course in the last few years this has now come back again and DNA seems to have in higher organisms some attachment to the cells.

## 122. DNA replication: isolating temperature sensitive mutants

> These experiments with François continued throughout 1962, and in that year we also got the idea that we would study DNA replication in some depth. And the way to do this we thought was to go and isolate temperature-sensitive mutants of replication. And so in that year I started a rather large project together with François to look for temperature-sensitive mutants of E. coli, which we did and we developed many, many ways of doing this, very quickly.
>
> And amongst these we found quite a number that were defective in DNA replication, because of course we wanted mutational evidence for our model. And if we... if, as we had predicted, there would be a positive element that would be required to start DNA replication, then a mutant of that, we argued, would not allow a bacterium actually to start DNA replication and therefore these bacteria should be blocked at start in this cycle of replication.
>
> Well, that work developed on quite a large scale, and many of the mutants we used, we isolated, later became very famous. In fact, it wasn't just one gene making an enzyme that was required for DNA replication, but indeed, the mutation certainly got as far as **DNA-Z, which means that there were at least 26 of these**. And some of the early ones... DNA-A which is the name of one of the elements involved in initiating DNA replication... it was of course the first one characterised, and DNA-B, which helps as well to do this, and C and D and so on.
>
> We had started with collaborators to... in... in the Pasteur Institute to characterise these mutants, and to show that some of them were involved in initiation, so that once the chromosome initiated it would go on and... and complete, and others were involved of course in the act of replication itself. And later those mutants were used with great effect by other people to identify the new genes, and by using extracts of these mutants and complementing them, many, many new functions were biochemically purified. So that new polymerases were discovered; in fact two new polymerases were discovered. A large number of cofactors that these required were identified and purified. And **Arthur Kornberg came back to DNA replication with a vengeance once these tools of discovery were provided**.

---

## 123. Conditional lethals

> There'd been a lot of work done on conditional lethals of bacteriophage, in that people had started to identify temperature-sensitive mutants. And later on the amber mutants were identified as conditional lethals... finding all the genes of an organism. While we were working in this I had started to isolate a number of mutants in bacteriophage T4 called minutes. I worked extensively on these minutes during 1960 when I could show that there were lots and lots of different ones. And they were difficult to work with, but we did in fact map quite a large number of ones. I didn't have the sense to see that these were just leaky mutants – that is, almost conditional, almost lethals. And that had I incubated some of them at a lower temperature I would have discovered that quite a lot of them were temperature-sensitive, and I just hadn't gone up high enough to knock them out completely. Later we did check our minute collection for temperature sensitivity and found indeed that they were temperature-sensitives.
>
> But that whole concept of **conditional lethals** opened up genetics in a most remarkable way. And in fact became the basis for a considerable amount of genetics since that time, and gave rise I think to the concept, which became important later, that Seymour used to call **genetic dissection**.

---

## 124. Virus assembly

> You could see that with the... with the mutants that affected the assembly of a phage, and amber mutants were studied extensively by Edgar and others of bacteriophage T4... were studied extensively by them, in which they found that all the pieces of phage that we have identified, when we smashed phage up with enzymes and had classified things as cores and sheaths and heads and used electron microscopy, the negative staining... now all extracts of these bacteria infected with phages missing in one particular gene could just be looked at.
>
> And of course **a most remarkable menagerie was discovered**. There were mutants with free heads and free tails – they hadn't glued them together. There were mutants in which the heads hadn't formed but formed polyheads. These are long, long tubes. There were polysheaths. And using all of this one could now get on to studying the most interesting questions of... of virus assembly. And the whole idea that this is made by a kit, that you make the parts first and then the parts stick together; really I think opened up the whole of the concept of how you make elaborate cell structures, and by this **hierarchical self-assembly mode**. And this led on to the *in vitro* work in which people could actually now take parts of viruses, mix them together, and make viruses; which was a development of exceptional technical and intellectual importance – that you could do this *in vitro*, and that you could then start to complement with different extracts, and that this could be done eventually, you know, with purified materials, so that everything... this again is a development of the kit of materials by which one can now study function.

---

## 125. Deciding to work on higher organisms

> I had been talking with Francis Crick about what we should do next and, you know, we felt we could now go and study the ribosome, for example. And you could set up a... a ribosomal project, and that would be we'd isolate all the proteins of the ribosome, we'd sequence all the proteins of the ribosome, and we'd then find out how ribosomes got built and how ribosomes got put together; we would do crystallography of the ribosomes and functional work. And indeed it took some 30 years for a few labs to do that program.
>
> Now we decided that none of these things seemed to us to be of great excitement, and one of the things that of course one had always been interested in – since I came from the study of animal cells, and Francis had a bit of a cell biology background himself – that of course **we wanted to know something about higher organisms**. And both of us were interested in the nervous system; I'd spent quite a lot of my youth working in it, but of course it was intractable at that stage. And so what I thought was: **we now have all these powerful genetic tools; can't we use them to approach more complex problems?**

---

## 126. The next important problem: development and differentiation

> Being interested in... in higher cells, one had to be interested not only the functions of more complex systems but also the... the big problem, which was development. And of course everybody there knew that differentiation – that is, how cells came to be different from each other, ostensibly carrying the same genetic information in a higher organism – that **differentiation was the next... the next important problem**.
>
> The grand paper of Jacob and Monod really gave you a means for seeing this. That is, you could get cells separate simply by turning off certain genes and turning on certain genes. In fact, Gunther Stent wrote an article saying that as far as he was concerned embryology or development was a solved problem, it wasn't interesting, for the simple reason that Jacob and Monod have already told us what to do. But as in all parts of biology **the more general the theory the more vacuous it is**.
>
> So that if you simply say development's just a matter of turning the right genes on in the right place at the right time and that's the answer, that's absolutely true but it's absolutely useless, because somewhere deep down in our cells **what we'd like to do is to actually go and make a mouse, to build a mouse**. Of course no one'll build a real mouse, but we'd like to be able to make a gedanken mouse.
>
> And so using those... that approach just became clear that one would have to do things in detail before one was satisfied, because the meanings of the genes in higher organisms are exactly so, such that they know how to compute the final mouse, and therefore you could say **the total or the final explanation of everything is to be able to compute animals from DNA sequences alone**. If you can get that, then we have an explanation of everything.
>
> And I've always used that as my criterion, and of course I've been severely criticised for saying that because everything anybody knows it's... says it's impossible. I should have added into that description: that is, DNA sequences plus some initial conditions which good physicists would always include. And of course it's in the definition of the initial conditions, that's the important thing.
>
> The only questions he asks are threefold, which is: **how does it get built? How does it work? And how does it get that way?** So those are the questions of development –in the broadest sense, of physiology, although the physiological question is asked first, and of evolution. And of course the latter I think's the most interesting of all of these, but still we have to work through the two first.
>
> And since all of this is written in some sense in the genes, that makes **genetics the master science of biology**. In fact it's the only science and all the others are just ways of getting to understand what the genes do. And I say that simply because that's what evolution must change, that's the material that evolution has to work for. And that's what we finally have to try to understand at the end of the day, or year, or century, or whenever it is.

## 127. Reasons for choosing to work on the nervous system

> With the idea that what I wanted to understand was: **how does the gene build an organism, development, and of course development of the nervous system?** Because that was the most complicated of all the things. In fact when people said, 'Why don't... why do you want to work on the nervous system; why don't you choose something simpler first, like the big toe or something like that?' I said that I worked on the nervous system because it became absolutely clear from that that no simple hypothesis would account for what there is. Because there the great... at that time the great fear is that everything would finally be explicable by beta-galactosidase, by Jacob-Monod theories on... that there'd be a repressor, you take off the repressor, this thing would be induced and that's the way you get it. And what we wanted is to get to a problem which was so difficult that in fact it wouldn't be so easily explained. And **the nervous system offered this possibility simply because everything... not only did you have to have cells, not only did you have to have cells in the right place, but they actually had to wire up together accurately**. And it is the wiring problem of the nervous system, where things grow for very long distance and hook up at the end of the day, at the end of their journeys with the right cell target, that seemed that you would need very special explanations, for that could not be accounted for in simple terms, and therefore this is really what one wanted to know.
>
> Well, one of the discussions we had during this time was in fact whether we try and decompose this into a set of subsidiary problems and tackle each one. So there'll be problems of how cells move – that clearly happens in higher organisms, cells move around. There'd be problems of how cells grow, there'd be problems of the polarity of cells in the sense that cells go in one direction and not in another, grow in one direction, or face the world from one side of themselves and not the other. So how was all of this polarity established? And then of course there were whole questions of how you turned on all the different genes in a cell that distinguishes, let us say, a neurone from a liver cell. How did you, how did things get to be that? And so maybe differentiation could be studied, in... separately from development, taken out of the context of development and attacked in a... in a higher cell. And so I began to look around for examples which because of a favourable biological history of that species might show this in some exaggerated or isolated form. That has been something I've always done, because I think such is the diversity of, of living forms that **you can always find a special case that aids you with your experiments**. And there were classic examples of this; acetabularia – which is an alga – was so big you could actually suck out the contents of the cell and analyse them. And you felt certain you were looking at the same kind of process. So where could one find cases in which the exemplar would be such that it would show the same process – that is, it had to be essentially the same process that you found inside a living organism, and that enabled you to investigate it more readily.

## 128. Choosing an organism to study

> I was ill one day and I asked my wife to get me a book which I'd phoned up Heffer's, the booksellers in Cambridge, which was on protozoa. I had looked at a lot of protozoa as... during my youth because I was interested in microscopy. I had cultures of paramecium on the lab bench in South Africa, and so I thought protozoa might be interesting. And I had read... I started to read very extensively – to add to my previous knowledge – over the whole of biology. I read... I read the whole textbooks of zoology, botany, followed up very specific organisms, traced very special organisms.
>
> In protozoa I had known that of course the paramecium was an object of genetic study. Tetrahymena, which was a... another protozoan, had been studied; people had started to do genetic crosses with them. And I also noted that there was a very interesting thing which, which was an organism called naegleria which underwent an... an amoeba flagellate transformation. That is, the amoeba – which crawled around on the substrate – noticed cell movement, then changed, grew a flagellum and then swam away.
>
> Then I got very interested in cell-counting systems. I mean, how... how do things know how to count numbers of cells? You know, organs grow toward a certain size. There were many, many cases of... that you could find in the literature of; for example, I was tremendously impressed by reading in the fly sciara that... which has supernumerary chromosomes which it gets rid of in all but two cells of the 16-cell stage after cleavage. And one can ask oneself: **how does it know that it's got 16 cells and that, you know, 14 minus... 14 + 2 = 16? There must be some kind of cell-counting thing**.
>
> I... the one I was most interested... was the amoeboflagellate thing, and I found it quite common once one got reading about this. And I thought: well, **I want an organism with a two-dimensional world, like bacteria, which can live on the surface of a petri dish**.

---

## 129. Choosing the nematode

> In the course of my reading I came across the micro-metazoa. These are little animals which are extremely interesting, and there were two kinds that I got interested in. One were rotifers, which I... of course, I'd known again as an amateur microscopist, and I actually went out to one of the ponds outside Cambridge and had a culture of rotifers – you could find these. And these looked very exciting, that is they weren't like... they weren't single cells; they were collections of cells. And these had sexual cycles and they had intestines and they had muscles and they were really small animals.
>
> And of course during the course of all this reading I came across the nematodes. And these looked far more promising. I had looked very carefully at the rotifers, and although I played around with them, extremely beautiful to look at, they had impossible sexual cycles, they were too slow.
>
> I also then found that these were very irritating, because they lived in three dimensions – they swam around in water. And I thought: well, **I want an organism with a two-dimensional world, like bacteria, which can live on the surface of a petri dish**. And so the... the nematodes seem... seemed to have all the properties; and the more I read about this the more I became totally excited by it and decided that **this is the organism that I would go for**.

## 130. Starting to work with nematodes and Richard Goldschmidt's paper

> I then started to isolate nematodes from nature to find the best one. And what we knew from the literature is that these had a small number of cells, they were limited... number of cells, and that the other thing they had was rapid growth and that, as it turned out, there were the right possibilities for sexuality in order that you could do genetic experiments.
>
> Now, we knew from really classic experiments, **Goldschmidt in the early part of the century had done the nervous system of ascaris**, and this is a remarkable set of papers, because if you read his life you will see that he did these when he was doing zoology as a student. And he made these dissections of ascaris, which is a very large parasitic nematode, largely of pigs, and that he found he could describe the entire nervous system, it had a few hundred cells, and he could also describe all the connections.
>
> When I went to look at the journal in the *Jahrbuch der Zoologie* in the Cambridge University Library I found all the pages uncut. So I was absolutely certain that no one had ever read that journal until I opened it in the early '60s, and that means it had been there for at least 50 years. And it's a absolutely classic paper.
>
> And therefore I said, 'Well, look, **this is an organism which will have a wiring diagram. So it should be possible to... to do the following: to determine the wiring diagram in an organism of the nerve cells; to also ask whether all organisms have the same wiring diagram if they have the same genes. So therefore we can say genes specify wiring diagrams**.' And the whole sort of conceptual layout was very clear in my mind before even starting – that what one would do is effectively get all the genes that fix the wiring diagram and then work out what they do.

## 131. Predicting behaviour from genes

> My good friend and colleague Seymour Benzer had also decided to drop phage and go into this. He decided to work with drosophila. And he had the idea that we would go from gene to function. He also had this view of genetic dissection which is take the phenotype, find out how many ways there are of breaking it, and now you have all the genes specifying this. And then what you could do was in fact try to relate these genes to the final function, so you could get a classification of the genotype.
>
> Of course, our theoretical views there were extremely primitive, but **I felt you could not relate the genes to function that simply**. Because I think the mapping of the genetic material onto this external phenotype would have to be quite complex in order to understand this.
>
> And so I thought to... to say... as we used to say, I... I remember these pictures of Lorenz being followed around by his ducks, and I read that ducks had this fixed behaviour, that they... they did this. And of course I wanted to know, you know, was there a gene, so to speak, to put the left foot forward, followed by another gene that said, 'And having done that put the right foot forward'? In other words, **what were the units of behaviour and did they map onto the genetic program?**

---

## 132. Relating genes to function

> I thought that there were two steps in this process. And the two steps I defined in a paper, which I wrote at the time, much later, but they had been defined earlier, and that is you ask the question: **how do you build nervous systems?** That's one question, and that's what the genes do. And then you ask: **how do these nervous systems work to generate behaviour?** And the important idea there is exactly the one that we had in molecular biology. You can't understand how this... how the gene corresponds to the phenotype without understanding the paradigm of construction between them, the construction paradigm. Once you understand that phage is put together by molecules into sub-assemblies and these sub-assemblies are glued together to make a phage, you can then understand how the gene, the genetic, the genes correspond to this geometrical structure. And so the same must be true of these higher organisms. And that you then separate the construction issue, the developmental issue, the building issue, from that of function, and the two are then interlocked, because clearly what organisms do is an output from the machines they have to do things with. What machines they have to do things is an output of their genes.
>
> So I think that made a clarification and showed that from a genetic point of view the most important question, at least for me, was: **how do genes build nervous systems?** And that is why I have... I just could not understand how all these people that have this endless argument in the field of behavioural genetics, which was very popular in the early '60s. And there were arguments about genes and intelligence, for example, which aroused tremendous anger of people saying it's just impossible that genes specify intelligence. And what you'd have to do, according to my view, is you'd have to show what is the machine inside the organism that generates intelligence and how do genes affect it? And until you have satisfied that... so that means you have to understand how people display intelligence, and that's one issue, and then you can go to the genes, and of course genes will affect it in the sense that they... they are needed to build your brain – you can't get rid of them, because if you don't have any genes you don't exist, so in that sense you have to do this. And that just means it's not a question of philosophy or belief or any... it's just a question of what it is.
>
> And of course you can see that the whole constraint of this is everything has had to be produced by evolution. Intelligence has had to be produced by evolution. Presumably unintelligent people in the early days didn't survive; they couldn't cope with the environment so they were eliminated. And once everything comes to us through this sieve, through this filter, and that filter has to work with genes, then you can see how all of these things are interrelated. And the one thing we can do in a laboratory is to dissect these... separate all these issues and define them in this way. The nematode seemed to be the best way of doing this, and I therefore started what is now known as **the C. elegans Project**.

## 133. How amber mutants were so-called

> There was one experiment which really was the kind of last dying whimper of the... well, it was a little bang I would say, of the original program. The original program was to look at the protein and then by doing genetics on the DNA and chemical mutagenesis is to work out the sequence of the DNA. That was the answer, i.e. the sequence of the coding. And the only place where that succeeded was with the nonsense codons.
>
> And that, that went roughly as follows. It had been known that some codons the... some mutations gave you nonsense. That had been discovered in the R2; because Seymour Benzer invented a little trick where he had a gene fusion and he could show he could turn off, in this gene fusion, the function of gene B, by some mutants in gene A, showing that these were important drastic mutants. I mean, we later used that to show that proflavine made very severe effects; that they could turn this off.
>
> Now, our work on the acridine mutants had shown us that a lot of the mutations, a lot of the codons had to be sense. That's because we could get frame-shifts over longer... over long regions. But we also knew that there was some nonsense.
>
> And so we started to work on these mutants; they were suppressible mutants, and I... and their history is quite interesting, because there were two strains of E. coli, and there were certain mutants that grew on one and didn't grow on the other, and in fact Seymour Benzer used that with the R2s, and so they then asked in Pasadena, 'Can we get this for other genes?' And so they called all the students together and said, **'We want you to do pick and stab, because you have to test each plaque individually, and the first one who finds the mutant we will call this after his mother'**.
>
> Okay. So the first student to find the mutant was a man called Hilliard Bernstein. All right, now you couldn't call them Bernstein mutants, but **amber – Bernstein is the German for amber**. So these mutants were called amber mutants. And that's how they remain, because they were called after Hilliard's mother who was also a Bernstein of course.

---

## 134. The Amber mutants

> These amber mutants had been known, and what was known is that they grew on one strain, didn't grow on the other, and I had... and you just said, 'well, what happens if you don't have an amino acid – what do you do? Do you just stop? I mean, does the thing get stuck?' In fact, we began to wonder that there could be dominant nonsense, because if the ribosome theory was correct, then tapes with these mutants that got stuck in it would just jam the entire system.
>
> So I had the idea that there were two kinds of nonsense, one got stuck and **one actually chain-terminated**. One actually chain-terminated. Right? And I said, 'Well, maybe this nonsense is chain-terminating; maybe there is a mechanism for terminating a chain – it isn't that you just fall off at the end. And if this is the case, then when you suppress it, then we think you just carry on the chain.' So these were the nonsense suppressors.
>
> And what we had is we knew the bacteriophage head protein, our old friend, has 70% of the protein synthesis, and so we decided we'd go and have a look to see if fragments of this protein were made. And the first experiment was done by a, a graduate student of mine called Anand Sarabhai, from which... from his success came the slogan **the luck of the Sarabhais**. And Anand was a fearless experimenter. He believed in having a go.
>
> So although he was judiciously advised even by Francis, not to do this experiment because it was bound not to work, he decided to have a go, and of course it worked. And then it became clear we didn't have to go through everything he did. We could use a little thing that Fred Sanger had been using and which we had started to use, which is radioactive labelling of the protein and fingerprinting. And of course suddenly we realised that we had all these amber mutants in this gene; that **we could give a topological proof of co-linearity – we wouldn't have to do any protein sequencing**.
>
> All we showed is that as the mutant moved to the right we got more and more of the protein. And we didn't have to do any sequencing. And... and that then opened up the whole idea of chain-termination.

---

## 135. Discovering other mutants

> In the meantime, we had discovered that there was another nonsense mutant, and because the amber had been called amber, I called them **ochre mutants**: O-C-H-R-E. So ambers and ochres was the thing, and we then discovered that there were a whole different set of suppressors for this. And there was a third kind of nonsense we suspected, and which took us quite a long time to find. And eventually we did find it, but by that time we'd got tired of these colours, although they had been called opal by someone and they did remain.
>
> I did... I thought for a moment I would call them umber mutants, but then I realised this wouldn't go down in England, you see, because there are parts of England where amber is umber and umber is oombah, you see, so there'd be a lot of confusion. So we left it at that.
>
> Now, what was very interesting was could we find the triplets for these nonsense mutants. And there is an experiment that I did, which was published together with some colleagues, which involved the protein synthesis, but **the genetic experiment is the one I'm extremely proud of. It's still used in teaching in America to students as a classic**.
>
> I... you... I could by making certain assumptions about mutagenesis, decide whether I was having, going from C to U, or what's equivalent, G to A, but I'd have to, to decode the triplet, know which chain I was working on because the DNA is double-stranded.
>
> And in that way I was able to prove – knowing that ambers and ochres and UGAs were connected – I was able to say that the nonsense mutants had a U, that one of them had a U and two As, one of them had a U and an A and a G, and the other one also had a U and an A and a G, but it was the other way around. And that the most likely sequence in that case was **UAG, UAA, and UGA**, because of their connections to amino acids.
>
> So only by that experiment, hydroxylamine mutation, and a lot of knowledge about what amino acids these were, did we fulfil just even the last bit of the original program of sequencing DNA. So I like to say **I did do it, I did sequence three bases in DNA by genetics** in this case. But that was the last sort of thing, and then from then on it was just... it had all become biochemistry.

---

## 136. Continued experiments in molecular genetics (Part 1)

> Now, while all of this was going on, we continued to do experiments in... in molecular genetics. Anand Sarabhai, one of my graduate students, who had what we call the luck of the Sarabhais, had in fact shown that amber mutants, these conditional lethals, cause chain termination, and that he could identify the chain terminated products directly without purification. And by doing this we were able to show, with a simple assumption, that a protein got started at one end and went to the other end and it was a topological argument that in fact **the genetic map was co-linear with the protein map**, not having to do sequences as Charles Yanofsky was doing at about the same time.
>
> Now, the amber mutants were very interesting, because what Anand had shown is that they chain terminated, and we then began to work on what were the amber triplets, and of course that is the only case where in fact we had completed the original program of molecular genetics without resorting to biochemistry. The idea was that we would analyse the structure of DNA by chemical mutagenesis. We'd analyse the structure of the protein and then we would be able to say, these triplets correspond to this protein, to this amino acid.
>
> We had already shown that there were these chain-terminating triplets in the R2 gene. In the R2 gene we had one strain in which the mutant could not grow. We had a strain, of course, where everything grew. So what we did is by using a chemical reagent, hydroxylamine, we treated bacteriophage with this. The argument is that hydroxylamine changed a base cytosine to uracil or an equivalent of it, and of course it could change one in the strand that has been copied into messenger or it could change one in the other strand.
>
> Therefore, if you took a family of bacteriophages containing some mutants and you passed them through the non-restrictive strain, then everything would ultimately become expressed. But if you took them and passed them through the restricting strain, then only those which contained unaltered cytosines on the sense strand, only those would grow through. And all the ones in which the cytosine had been altered on the sense strand so it was now read incorrectly, that would make a mutant gene product and would not pass through.

---

## 137. Continued experiments in molecular genetics (Part 2)

> What we knew is that the two nonsense triplets were related to each other by base changes. So that meant they contained... that one contained an A or a U in the same place where the other contained a G or a C. We could tell that direction.
>
> And of course we were in fact working on C. elegans at the time and our people were taken off that to help. The experiment took... results... needed **the isolation of a few thousand R2 mutants to get the subset of amber mutants only**. And these were isolated on a steady routine of a few hundred each day. They were sieved through and ultimately the two sets were mapped, complemented and identified.
>
> And it was very interesting because we had repeated occurrences of mutants. Those repeated occurrences gave us confidence that we had a... a spectrum there, that we were not just randomly choosing them. And with this spectrum we could compare the two spectra and could find certain peaks were missing in the one strain, whereas one peak was present, other peaks were present in both. That allowed us to assign that as a C, as an... a G or an A.
>
> And of course it was UAG because we knew what amino acids they were connected to, and those were beginning to come out. And so you could have said that had we, you know, gone on plodding in this way we might have been able to work out the whole of the code, but in fact the only survivor of the original program was this effort at determining whether the... which proved really for an immense amount of effort that there was both a U and an A in the... in the codon of the... of the nonsense codons.

---

## 138. Genetic suppression: our beginnings with genetic engineering

> We had this problem of genetic suppression. And this is a... another interesting story because it is really **our beginnings with genetic engineering; it's what I used to call genetic steam engineering, because we had to do things by brute force**.
>
> And one of the things we wondered was a consequence of our... of suppression is that when we put back an amino acid into the amber codon what we've changed is a normal transfer RNA. And we... and that would mean of course that there had to be either many... many... two... at least two different genes, because we would take it away from its normal reading and allow it to read this and make a misprint, so to speak.
>
> And, of course, one way of proving it was of course to work out the sequence of transfer RNA in the modern in this... these... in these beasts. Fred Sanger had been developing RNA sequencing techniques and in fact the structure of a... of an RNA had been determined by Holley, and of course that... that RNA had been purified from yeast by an enormous amount of work using countercurrent distribution, it had been sequenced by a very elaborate, very... well, I shouldn't say elaborate... a very simple means, but it required a lot of material.
>
> And Fred was working out micro methods for doing this, had succeeded in doing this, and so our very simple idea which is: you just do it for proteins. If you have a mutant RNA, you can just determine its sequence and... and just work it out. A question: how do you find this RNA? You have to purify it.
>
> However, I was very much imbued with what I'd done with the phage protein because I had avoided purification simply by just using something that was a huge amount of the synthesis and that could be... so to speak, dominate everything else. We didn't have to purify it, because **as long as everything else is spread over hundreds of species, if yours is a half or even a third you only see yours as the intense thing, because everything else is background**.

---

## 139. Lambdoid phages: phage 80 (Part 1)

> There was a whole field at the time which involved in doing genetic engineering with lambda in a very primitive way. And this had been in the discovery of the so-called lambda DGs. What they found was that certain lambdas carried all or part of... of the galactose gene that... that had become joined to the lambda by an accident of natural genetic engineering during the course of a growth.
>
> Since these are extremely rare, say maybe one every 100 million phages, you had to have a special means to fish it out, and it had become clear that this phage was doing this – was picking up genes from either the left- or right-hand side of the chromosome surrounding it... its site of insertion.
>
> We had for other reasons, because we had been mapping ambers and ochres and had got into genetics and I'd got an interest in these lambdoid phages, and Ethan Signer was working with me on the lambdoid phages. We had a little side program on these, and we became very interested in a phage called 80, phage 80, which effectively inserted at a different part of the chromosome and picked up the tryptophan genes.
>
> I had gone for a sabbatical to Berkeley – this was about... this was 1965 – and I was determined not to do any more genetics with bacteria. I was already quite heavily engaged in the... in the C. elegans project, and I had told everybody, 'I'm taking a sabbatical, I'm going to write up everything I've done on... on the phage and I don't want to see it again', and what they must do is see if they can find a phage 80 with this gene attached.
>
> And I came back to find that **all they'd done is sat around talking about it, and no one had done the experiment**. And I broke my resolve and it didn't take me very long – I think it took me a week – I had... I had 80 phages with this gene attached.

---

## 140. Lambdoid phages: phage 80 (Part 2)

> I went to a colleague called John Smith, who was interested in RNA and RNA sequencing and so on, and I said, 'Look, I think I've got this suppresser on a phage, and if we induce it and then just do an assay which would just simply ask how much of the RNA that you extract after this cell has come up, how much of this would be... would be this tyrosine TRNA?'
>
> And I said, 'Well, you know, I mean, it should be an enormous amount, because if the tyrosine tRNA is one-fifth... one-twentieth, because there are 20 tRNAs for the 20 amino acids, and I'm going to increase its synthesis by, let us say, 10 or a hundred times – somewhere between that, because I have 100 copies of the phage growing in it – so let's say conservatively it should be half. And this means nearly everything should load up with tyrosine.'
>
> So we did the experiment on a Friday afternoon – I remember this – and it was all processed on the Monday, and of course what we didn't know then is that the gene for this was a minor transfer RNA, not the major one. It was something that was only about a tenth of that again. So absolutely would have had a lot of trouble finding it. And, of course, what we got was a threefold increase.
>
> Now, that means that that gene had increased more like 300-fold, more like 100-fold as it worked out, and there would have been no hope to have found that sequence, we would have only purified the major one. However, it was workable to do this from these phage infected things. And of course the first experiment was simply to take the normal allele of this and put it on the same phage and compare the two.

---

## 141. Caulobacter and tetramitus

> As a model of polarity I... I played around in 1965 – this is very early – with caulobacter. In fact, I made some mutants of caulobacter. Caulobacter is a bacterium that has a very interesting life cycle which involves a polar... polar growth. I also explored tetramitus bacteria as another possible model system for studying differentiation.

---

## 142. Cultivating organisms and pervertebrates

> I did all of these experiments with my own hands, for the simple reason that **I loved the cultivation of organisms**. I think I just loved the idea of growing all these strange bacteria and one of the things that I always want... I always... always found interesting to do is in fact to bring it to the stage that in fact other people can take it over and develop all the little tricks... tricks about... about handling the organisms oneself.
>
> After many of these desultory excursions I came to the conclusion that many of these sub-models were not... would not necessarily tell us the right thing, and it was at that time... it was some time later that I invented this new class of organisms. I used to say that organisms are divided into vertebrates, invertebrates, and the third class were called **pervertebrates**. These were organisms that were thought to be like others but were simply models of themselves.
>
> Like slime moulds is the one I did apply this to, much to the anger of the people who worked on this, who felt that they had been thereby reduced to a lower position in the hierarchy of biological investigations. I pointed out to them, position was not lower; it was just on the side.

---

## 143. The unique research environment in the Cambridge labs

> One of the things that we had in our lab was a very large number of very high level, dedicated, post-doctoral fellows, largely from America who came during this period to work on molecular genetics with us. And of course the suppressors and the tRNAs there were available for lots and lots of projects, and a large number of people cut their teeth on this and made themselves rather famous as a result of it.
>
> But it was part of the work that provided sustenance for the laboratory and such people, the people who worked on the tRNA from about '65 onwards were Howard Goodman, John Abelson, Malcolm Gefter and in fact **Sidney Altman worked on this and Sidney Altman, through this, discovered the RNA processing**, because what he found with many of the mutants is that they were blocked at the precursor stage. So he discovered the precursors of phage and of course that took him on to his later work on finding RNA processing and which awarded him the Nobel Prize with Tom Cech later.
>
> And that was one of the things that I think we did rather well in Cambridge, which was to have these fields and have people take them and work on them on their own, and each person to have a part of the project that he could run himself. And it taught people really how to do science, and of course had that very comforting thing that **no one else in the world was working on it**. And that's the greatest thing for all morale in the lab, because if you sit in a laboratory and you think, my God, there are 100 labs working on this project, each of these 100 labs have 40 people in them, that's 4000 to 1 I'm not going to win. Those are terrible odds, and that just means that no one does anything.
>
> But what is wonderful is to say, you know, this is exclusive, so to speak, at this stage, the science is, and we can do this without having the hordes come in and turn it into industrialise it. Basically that's what I think happens in science is we now have managers, we now have a scientific/industrial complex, if you like, and so various topics are then industrialised, they're exploited to the hilt, and remarkably, they vanish.
>
> And I always used to say that **the best thing in science is to work out of phase**. That is, either half a wavelength ahead or half a wavelength behind. It doesn't matter. But if you're out of phase with the fashion you can do new things.

---

## 144. Satisfaction of completing 20 years studying *Caenorhabditis elegans*

> About 1963, although we'd moved to our new building in the Hills Road, it had been agreed that we, we should get some more space. When... I can remember this because in a review of my... of our lab Harold Himsworth who was then the secretary of the MRC [Medical Research Council], he came to me and said, well, were we satisfied with what the MRC had done for us?
>
> And I said, yes, you know, this is quite good as a first... as a first step, but because now I think the time is ripe to go into many things and join more people together here, maybe we could have, you know, some other development. And this project began then that we would get some extra space. Part of the space would be devoted to this new work that Francis and I were going to expand into, which was some combination of developmental and neurobiology.
>
> And in fact, I wrote a little thing which we put into our request for a new building and it's quite a remarkable document - it's published - and it just says what we're going to set out to do with the *C. elegans* [*Caenorhabditis elegans*] project. And that was, you know... **we will find the position of every cell and its origin in development**, and it's quite interesting that when I wrote this thing, some 25 years later, I could actually say, **well, we've actually completed everything we said we would do then**. We didn't think it would take, you know, 20 years or more, but it's been done. It is complete.

---

## 145. Choosing electron microscopy to study mutants

> How were we going to study the mutants? And what I'd come to the conclusion was that we'd have to do electron microscopy. Now, why was that? That was very simple: because if I wanted to see which cell was joined to another cell, I would have to look at membranes. So I'd have to look, and this is the fault of all other microscopic anatomy, they all got lost in the neuropile, they couldn't trace out the connections. But **an electron microscope can resolve membranes, can resolve small things**, and so we said, well, with the electron microscope you could trace the path quite... quite adequately.
>
> And what we needed to do was to do three-dimensional electron microscopy, just get all the information. Now, how were we going to do that? In a very classical mode. I had, as a student, reconstructed a brain of galago by serial sectioning of colloidal sections, and by tracing these on paper and transferring these to slices of wax, I actually made a three-dimensional model of this brain in wax with all the... the holes in it and you could open it up and look inside, and so we decided we'd have to do something like that.
>
> We'd have to cut serial sections and we'd have to go from one section to the other and trace it. Now, the electron microscope is extremely powerful, but it has a very tiny window, you can only look at a small piece of it at a time. And so to do this even on one neurone of a higher organism would be... would be impossible. That meant for one to do this on a whole organism, **we would have to get something that was very, very small in order to fit it into the window of the electron microscope**. And that of course was the dominant condition saying we must go to micro-metazoa, because they were small and they did fit into the window of an electron microscope.

---

## 146. The importance of finding the wiring diagram

> The small size of the nematode - the adult is only 1 millimetre in length and about 40 microns in cross section, and the larva of course is much smaller - meant that these could be fit well into the window of the electron microscope. And the idea then evolved, well, what we would do is **we will determine the wiring diagram of an... of an animal**. And at the same time we will make mutations, and then we'll see what alterations we will get in this wiring diagram, and then we will be able to relate this to the genes.
>
> von Neumann's theories on pattern recognition, algorithmic explanations, and behavioral neurobiology led to the understanding that obtaining a **complete wiring diagram** is essential to understand complex biological systems. So the big job was: **find the wiring diagram**.

---

## 147. Encoding in DNA requires the correct 'language'

> Now, of course lots of people said you'll never be able to tell from the wiring diagram whether a synapse is inhibitory or excitatory. Well, it should be possible to take nervous systems where you have a wiring diagram and compute with them that if you assumed these were excitatory and these were inhibitory you will find that certain states of these systems jam. They're incompatible.
>
> And, in fact, it seems to me to be very reasonable to start to ask what things, given this kind of general structure, are impossible. Because **exclusion is always a tremendously good thing in science**, if you can say it is impossible for this to be inhibitory; we actually could show that in one small sub-case, which we did.
>
> And I think when people said, how would you actually do this, then the argument was: it would be done by simulation. And it was during that time that I developed the concept I called then **a proper simulation as against an improper one**. Now, let me just give a definition of that. If you take these little worms, they crawl around on the surface of an agar plate, and anybody can write a program on a Macintosh or any computer that has little worms crawling around on a screen - little squiggles - and they squiggle around and they... they look as though they're doing the right thing. And you say, there you are, I've simulated the movement of the worm. But I call that **an improper simulation**, because all you've done... so I ask you, please show me the program, and I look at the program and the program is full of sine theta, cos theta, okay?
>
> So what you've done is you've... you have noted, you have described the behaviour of the worm in a rather strange language, which happen... may happen to be Fortran or C, and which implements sine theta, cos theta, right? It's a... it's a description. What I would have expected to find in the program were lists of neurones, lists of connections, lists of things that have to happen, right. And so **a proper simulation must be done in the machine language of the object being simulated**.
>
> And I think that if you do it that way, then I argue **the computer program is the explanation**. Now, if you have that, you can explain everything about the nervous system, all right. Now, you need a complete wiring diagram because modellers... there's always... are always confronted by the sceptic. So if you come and explain to the sceptic, 'I have modelled this behaviour, we got this oscillator, this interacts with this, it's coupled in this way and it does it', and he says, 'That's very nice, but how do you know there isn't another wire which goes from this point, you know, comes, goes right around the back and comes in at the side again?' And what you need to be able to say in all of these is: **there are no more wires - we know all the wires**.

> These nematodes simply remember in their DNA to build the same nervous system, which then has the same behaviour, right, because there's no learnt behaviour. So it's a bad use of the word 'memory', but it does say what you have to do in order. **If you wish to encode complex things in DNA, you must have the read-out system. And then the read-out system for encoding behaviour in DNA is the capacity to build a nervous system of this particular sort.**

## 148. Martini's with Lord Rothschild leads to Nichol Thomson joining the team

> I was very fortunate at the time, Lord Rothschild was a good friend of mine and I used to go and drink martinis with him every weekend. And he was for many years a scientist in the zoology department, and when he stopped doing science he had a technician - Nichol Thomson - who worked for him for many years, and whom he was anxious to find a job for.
>
> And he talked to me about it, and I said, this is ideal, I'd love to - Nichol was an electron microscope technician - and I said, I will get Nichol a job. And of course I wanted him, so he came and joined me.
>
> I have to say we had a lot of problems at the time because Nichol hadn't had a... a higher education in his life, having been born in a small... a small town in Scotland and not... had not completed much of... of higher education, let alone school education. And of course this was still... this was just in the days where people began to worry about qualifications and so on, which I think's completely nonsense.
>
> And of course we had to have... have a lot of arguments with administrators. We finally got Nichol a... a decent appointment, and he came in and began to tackle the problem... of these little beasts.

## 149. 'Just bring me back some soil from holiday'

> I had got a lot of nematodes, because I was trying to find out which grow best. In fact, I wanted to do temperature-sensitive mutants. And so I thought most nematodes, you see, live... the highest temperature's 25 degrees. So I thought what if we get nematodes from the equator? Surely, you know, that... they... they might be used to 37 degrees, because then we can get temperature-sensitive mutants, you know, and begin to... do the whole of the conditional lethality more easily.
>
> This is totally the wrong idea but is an amusing story. And so I was talking to Victor who was then director of research for Shell, and took a map of the world and we looked at where all oil facilities are around the world. And there's a lot of them on the equator, plus or minus 5 degrees. Oil in Nigeria, Malaysia, South America. And so through Victor it was arranged that everybody would bring back some soil dug up, you know, from outside the airport, from which I, I got nematodes, you know.
>
> I also got from Rothamstead a lot of nematodes that eat fungi and which they were interested in. These were of course plant parasites there. And we also collected a large number from around Cambridge, and **every time someone went on holiday I said, just bring back some soil**.
>
> And Nichol actually went home to Scotland and brought home a sample of soil from which I got a very interesting animal, which was asymmetric, the left side was different from the right side. Unfortunately, we lost the culture - some of these were hard to maintain - but we certainly got up to over 60 of these strains.

## 150. *Caenorhabditis elegans*: the perfect hermaphrodite

> Eventually what it turned out is that a very famous nematode called *Caenorhabditis elegans* was the one that worked. Now I'd got this culture, *C. elegans*, it had been isolated in Bristol and a strain had also been isolated in France where a man called Nigon had worked on it, that was called the Bergerac strain. This other one was called Bristol.
>
> And there was, there was a man called Dougherty in the United States - was at Berkeley - and he was interested in nematodes, had been for a long time. He worked in a department of nutrition, and was interested in what did nematodes eat.
>
> And out of all of these animals I... I liked very much *C. elegans*, because it had a beautiful sex life. It was what is called **the self-fertilising hermaphrodite**. That is first the gonad develops into a testis, and then stops, and then the gonad switches off to make oocytes and then these two fertilise each other. So each animal is the result of a cross of itself with itself, and **there's no better inbreeding than to cross yourselves with yourself all the time**.
>
> So this animal then had the property of being completely isogenic, because each animal would have a uniform genetic constitution, it would be a clone, so to speak. Furthermore, it... you could easily see that when you made mutants, those mutants would then segregate in the cross of that animal, in the Mendelian proportions. Then also these nematodes have occasional males which crop up in cultures and you can use these males to move genes from one animal to another.
>
> That gave you the whole basis of doing genetics. They had a very rapid life, they lived on *E. coli* [*Escherichia coli*], and it looked as though they might be axenised and so after some... some time of looking at lots and lots of others, **we alighted on *C. elegans***.

---

## 151. Using John Sulston's method for freezing nematodes

> One of the things that you want when you're doing a lot of genetics is, in fact, to be able to store them and... to store clones of these animals. With E. coli [Escherichia coli] it was very easy. We just froze them in glycerol. And just put them away like this. So that you could keep this tremendous inventory of different clones. It's one of the... it's one of the databases geneticists want, is to be able to go and find mutants.
>
> Phage was perfect, you just keep it in little bottles, a drop or two is enough, so it doesn't take much room. Of course, if you work with mice you've got to keep on breeding them, it's very hard to store. And so we wanted some way of storing these genes, we didn't want to keep on propagating them, because that becomes an enormous labour.
>
> And fortunately we very... it was discovered by John Sulston I was doing these experiments as well, I hadn't had much luck, and he discovered that, that if you... the book said that if you froze nematodes, froze anything in liquid nitrogen... of course it was very interesting of... of storage, it's cryogenics and, of course, everybody wants to store things, and we quickly learned that **it's very easy to put... to freeze things in liquid nitrogen, it's thawing that's the problem**.
>
> So what we found was that when you store cells in liquid nitrogen you're supposed to thaw them very rapidly. And... and that was the thing and you're supposed to freeze them rapidly. But we found that **if we froze them slowly and thawed them, then this was the best way to do it**. And so by slow freezing, about a degree a minute, you could in fact preserve these animals and thaw them and have them come alive.

## 152. E1: The first isolated *Caenorhabditis elegans* mutant

> We also found very quickly that they were susceptible to mutagenesis, by a compound called EMS - ethylmethane sulphonate - and indeed, you can mutate their genes at about the same frequency as you can mutate the genes of the *E. coli*... The E1 mutant naming convention and laboratory record-keeping practices were established early in the project.

---

## 153. Mendelian experiments with behavioural mutants

> We then pushed ahead on a number of things simultaneously, and it's the sort of thing that I like to do is to have lots of things to do, so if one gets stuck you go on with the other thing. And we started to master the... we started to master the techniques of serial sectioning. And this work really began with myself, Nichol Thompson and another one of my technicians, Muriel Wigby, who came with me from phage genetics and started to help me to do the nematode genetics.
>
> During this time we invented **the toothpick method of picking up nematodes**. All you needed was a dissecting microscope so you should look at them. There were very remarkable things happened. For example, people said, how do you pick behavioural mutants? What you have, you have a whole lot of nematodes, some of them are mutants, some of them are not. And what turned out is you have to learn what it is. And you do it by the following criteria: **anything that looks funny or different, you pick it up and you put it on a little petri dish by itself. If its children are different - show the same difference - well, then it's a mutant because it's inherited**, all right.
>
> And now you can look... then you have to cross it and make sure you can segregate the mutant in 1/4 of the population. So you then cross it. If you can do a Mendelian experiment with it and get the 3:1 ratio, then you can see the difference.
>
> And what I did is I asked people to keep records of their mutant yields, because I kept it on my own, from each kind of... batch of experiments. So you could tell **how fast you were learning to discern differences** between wild type. This is the kind of experiment of its own. And what happened was our first experiment, we only got two mutants, and the second one we got 10, and the third one we would get about... we... we began to get about 30-40, which was exactly where it plateaus from each batch of plates that you can handle in the cycle - 30-40 mutants. And you plateau and this means you've learnt to discern all of these and you start now to find repeats, and this has happened to everybody in this field.

## 154. *Caenorhabditis elegans*: finding drug resistant mutants

> Then I started to work on drugs. What I did is I got every drug capable of curing nematodes, you know, things they fed to cattle or pigs to cure them of this, or sprayed on plants and so on. And, of course, we found that some of these paralysed the nematodes. There's a very good one called Tetramysol, which paralysed nematodes.
>
> I then found I could get resistant mutants to them, and we then developed these techniques of **selecting for rare mutants by taking a petri dish and putting a few thousand nematodes on one side of it and giving some bacteria on the other side**. Of course, the nematodes can smell the bacteria and know they've got to get there, but of course it's only the ones that can move will get there very efficiently.
>
> Of course, you've got to give these others a little bit of bacteria so that they segregate the mutants. And with this you could always tell if there were mutants, because we could look down on the dish and see tracks of mutants and then go round and find this one. And so we could have very, very selective... this is almost like plating out bacteria.
>
> And so we found drug-resistant mutants of various sorts and they were put into the machinery. All of this then began to... to build up and began to attract other people. In fact, some people joined us from the transfer RNA experiments.

## 155. Diffusion gradients in development

> Well, during this period in the mid and late '60s, Francis had got very interested in gradients. The idea was – and it was one of the things that Lewis Wolpert had put forward as... a new idea in embryology – that **cells took up their characteristics from their positions in a gradient field**. Now the... the idea of gradients in development is very old. It goes back to the last years of the last century [sic], where in fact gradients were observed in eggs. But this idea was in fact, I think, very novel and Lewis didn't get much interest in this.
>
> I can remember finding Lewis in Woods Hole in the late '60s very depressed, saying that he'd given these lectures on gradients and no one had paid any attention to him. At that time I was teaching in Woods Hole and I can remember people discussing questions like, is differentiation a state or a process? And in fact, to try and explain the difference between these, I asked people the... what is the difference between laid-back and mellowing out? Some of... some people may remember these great words of the '60s. And, of course, that's exactly the difference between a state and a process. **Mellowing out is a process, and laid-back is a state**. Of course, by mellowing out you hope to reach the laid-back state.
>
> However, what Francis got interested in was that the sizes of things – and that's the thing he noticed – were scaled about to what you would expect from a diffusion gradient. And so Francis began to do calculations on this, and indeed began to interest people in experiments.

---

## 156. Francis Crick's interest in gradients

> Francis himself had got very interested in gradients. And he had got interested in what I told him about my meeting with Lewis Wolpert in Woods Hole, in which I found Lewis, as I've remarked, crying in the wilderness - I mean, literally crying, not... not yelling or screaming but with tears in the wilderness - because he could not get a single person there to understand what he was talking about. And everybody had just dismissed this in one of two ways. Either it had all been done before and was old-fashioned, or this is no way to explain things.
>
> Because at Woods Hole in that year I well remember a... a secret seminar which was held in the house of one of the... of a very high class exclusive to which I'd gone to, in which they had discussed the question of whether differentiation was a state or a process.

---

## 157. 'Émigrés' often make the best discoveries

> We had by now, in the late '60s, obtained some more space from the MRC [Medical Research Council]. The idea was originally that I would have a division of my own. The lab then was divided into... like Gaul, it had been divided into three divisions. I was supposed to get the fourth, but Francis and I agreed we would combine ours. And, of course, we changed its name, from Molecular Genetics to Cell Biology. And our idea was to import as many people as we could get hold of to work in this field.
>
> There were a large number of young English... young English people in America in different labs, and one of the things we did was to bring some of them back. And the idea was that they could work on anything they liked provided it had something to do with these new problems of development, or of how cells perform in development.
>
> And being one of the great successes of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology that in fact **you could come from any background and if the... if you were interested in the... in the actual problem and on how to resolve it, then that qualified to get you in**. For example, Graham Mitchison wrote to me - he was an algebraic topologist, his only contact with biology, I suppose, is because his uncle Avrion Mitchison was an immunologist - and we said okay, come and work... come and work on development and these gradients. **John Sulston was an organic chemist by background. John White was an engineer**.
>
> And I've always found that **the best people to push a science forward are in fact those who come from outside it**. Maybe that's the same in culture as well. The **émigrés are always the best people to make the new... make the new discoveries**.
>
> So if you like, when someone said to me once, what is the nature of the organisation in your laboratory? I could only think of one reply, which was, **'Loose gangs'**. There were just groups of people who got together and whose aim was to push the subject forward. And that is how I think this whole new work developed.

## 158. Computing: the beginning of the love affair

> One of the most interesting things that happened in this time is the kind of long love affair with computers that got consummated during this period. We needed to record an enormous amount of information of the reconstruction of the nervous system. We wondered a lot how this would be done, and of course came to the conclusion that we should use a computer to help us.
>
> And of course in those days biologists were very antagonistic to computers. They thought that anybody interesting in computing was choosing the easy way out of a responsible job. In other words, **if you didn't work at the bench you weren't worth anything**.
>
> Graham Mitchison was a mathematician, and of course so was David Marr. And we asked the MRC [Medical Research Council] for a computer to help us do this work, that is put the... put the data of the reconstruction into the machine.
>
> Now, in those days computing was only done in computer centres, and the idea that you would have a dedicated machine devoted to one kind of project was still very rare indeed. And in fact certainly organisations like the MRC hadn't come up to this because they were very interested into how many operators we would have, how many shifts we would have, and in fact we tried to tell them that we don't want to do computing this way, **computers should be servants and not masters**.
>
> In fact, that's when I invented something called *ad hoc* for a style of computing. When someone said what did *ad hoc* stand for, I said it stood for **hands-on computing**.

---

## 159. Modular 1: The first computer for the lab

> I'd been very impressed by what I'd seen at the MIT group on... in the artificial intelligence group, where my friend from South Africa, Seymour Papert, now had a job as a professor in... in MIT and working with Marvin Minsky. And while getting to Woods Hole in the late '60s I renewed my long... my acquaintance... my friendship with Seymour and visited the MIT Artificial Intelligence Centre on many occasions. And I could already begin to see that **computers would not only be laboratory tools, but in fact they would contain the essence of what we might be doing in the future**.
>
> Of course in those days if you asked for an American machine you never got it. And I remember we did pursue the possibility of buying a used computer, which the MRC [Medical Research Council] thought was rather, you know... to be suspected. I mean, nobody, no, no good organisation buys a second-hand computer. But we finally decided to... they told us we had to get an English machine, and we finally found a machine that had... a very advanced machine, advanced beyond its time, called the Modular I.
>
> So we got this machine and in the new building one floor had been left out. Not built. The idea was that we could occupy... the idea the MRC had was that they would build the entire building, but not... build the shell of certain parts and leave room for further expansion. And so this was a shell of a building which was just concrete, it was just... it was the most wonderful building I've ever worked in.
>
> We needed acres of space because in those days this computer had no means of doing anything except an assembly program... an assembler program - had no high-level language programmed for it, and all input and output was done on paper tape. And I can remember **lying on the floor with all of this paper tape unwound, going through and editing the single punched holes with... with patches**, saying, well, you know, this should not be 101, but should be 110, this byte here, and actually going and drilling the holes again and putting it in.
>
> I think it was the most interesting period in the sense that that is where one got down to the actual essence of computing. And David Marr and John White and Graham Mitchison and I had become so skilled that we thought nothing of sort of writing graphical operating systems for this... for this machine.

---

## 160. Writing my own computing language for Trac

> One of the things I did was, to teach myself computing thoroughly, I decided to implement a language. And this language I found in a publication, it's called TRAC — T-R-A-C — It's Text Reckoner And Compiler, published in the *Journal of the American Association of Computing Machinery*, 1965, by a man called Calvin Mooers, who I ascertained two years ago was still alive.
>
> And I was very impressed by this because I actually did write an interpreter for it, and... and became so fascinated by this language that **even on my present machines the first thing I've done is write an interpreter for Trac**, and my versions of Trac include a whole lot of new constructs, and these have never been published. So I think **the idea that one has a private computer language seems to me to be rather sophisticated** and perhaps we can all emulate that in the future.
>
> And so... but having done that really I got to the heart of computing. The... and I think it's important, not because you know, it's an accomplishment — one likes to say like one can run a mile in, you know, in less than ten minutes or something — but simply because by thinking about computers, by thinking about other complex objects and how one will try and account for them, I think that this has laid the grounds for most of the way now that I view biological systems, and which I think increasingly everybody else will have to view them in this way.
>
> Which is of course a return to the old von Neumann paradigm which is **if you can't compute it you can't understand it**. And... that I... and of course the association with someone like David Marr was very interesting, and of course by that time he was interested in the way the brain works to do complex things, I've not been very interested in that. I've been much more interested in the way the genomes work, because of course in our brains there's something called consciousness lurking around and, but of course **in genomes are completely unconscious and that seems to me to offer a much more challenging way of doing things**.

---

## 161. Lineage and special computation: European plan vs American plan

> I used to call the European plan versus the American plan. And I said that in Europe was the most... you don't give a damn who your neighbours are and where you live, the most important thing is who were your ancestors. And so that was a thing in which you had a computation which depended on **lineage**. You are what you are because this is the way you got there.
>
> As opposed to what I call **the American plan, which is you don't give a damn who your ancestors are, what's most important is who are your neighbours**. This I called the spatial computation. That is, if you wish to know what you are, you investigated who your neighbours were.

---

## 162. Genes make proteins, but what for?

> There were lots of arguments and discussions in the literature as to how we would ever get an explanation of development and there were lots of schools of thought about this. And one of the problems was relating all of this at that level, to what we felt had to be molecular information... I mean, in the end **genes make proteins and proteins have to do something, so what is it they are doing?**
>
> Well, of course they could be synthesising and destroying morphogenetic chemicals. So there was a great search for these morphogenetic chemicals. And some... in some organisms things that behaved as though they were morphogenetic chemicals were to be... were found. And many people didn't believe these, that there would be gradients of diffusible compounds, largely on the grounds that if they existed the biochemists would have already found them. Since the biochemists hadn't found them they can't exist. And I think that there was a lot of confusion about... that diffusion would be consistent with the results of the experiment, but it's not necessary that things should travel necessarily by diffusion, and need not necessarily be small molecules like this.
>
> During this time we got very interested in a series of experiments that had been done on... which seemed to... to give the most challenging problem in all of this, which was **the wiring up of the retina**, to, in lower organisms, the tectum. Everybody knew that the eye was projected onto the tectum in a very careful manner, so that each part got projected onto a certain region, and so the geometry was perfectly represented. But what was amazing was that there were experiments in frogs that if you cut these projections and let them regenerate, they could regenerate right to the... to the correct place and rewire the nervous system appropriately. Now, when you think about that... that said there had to be some kind of code of specification. And one of the questions at the time was: **was there a code of recognition in the nervous system?** If we have to make so many synaptic connections, how was this encoded?

---

## 163. Molecular recognition using the Beilstein paradox

> Sperry had put forward what was called the chemoaffinity. What he proposed is that each recipient had a molecule and each donor had a molecule, and only when they matched could... would the nerves wire up, so that you had these matching sets which had to meet. And of course if you were to think of... of how that... that would work, you would have to have a very large number of specific molecules.
>
> Now, of course at the time many people thought that there is another thing where we seem to have a lot of specific molecules; it's in the immunological system. You know, everybody said something we called **the Beilstein paradox**. Beilstein is a big, is a big book of organic chemistry and describes all the organic chemicals that have been found. And people have said well, we're sure that if you take a chemical out of Beilstein you can make an antibody to it. And of course we have to think not only there... are there a 122 volumes of Beilstein now, but there's going to be, you know, 10^22 volumes of Beilstein written over the next 20 years, and of course this statement will be equally true. So how does the antibody first of all know what's been published in Beilstein and secondly, a more, a deeper question: how's it going... how does it know what is not yet published in Beilstein but will be in the future?
>
> So what is in fact the landscape of this area of chemical... of molecular recognition? And it becomes very clear that it has to be a rather more complicated thing than, you know, one antigen, one antibody, and it means that **everything must be pluralistic** in a sense. That is, one antigen can be recognised by more than one antibody, and perhaps one antibody can recognise more than one antigen, and then we can, we can think of how that will become a code.
>
> Szilárd, in fact, wrote a paper about how the nervous system would be wired up by this form of chemical recognition, and what is more, he used the paradigm of immunisation as a model of learning. In other words, if you wanted to do new things you kind of formed a molecule, an antibody, if you like, that... that learnt what this new thing in, and therefore that would allow you to have learnt it. In that sense the antibody system does show a kind of molecular learning thing; once exposed to a chemical configuration it learns what that is and produces an antibody.
>
> Now of course it doesn't learn it in the sense of doing some big interpretation of the structure then computing what it has to do. Because that would be one way of learning, and of course it learns by being totally ignorant, which is the cheapest way. Which it says, **if it works do it, if it doesn't work forget about it**. And so I mean, it is learning under the regime of total ignorance that distinguishes the antibody system from what we might speculate as learning. This is quite important because many people now can't make the clear distinction between selection and acquisition in this sense.

## 164. Theories may be logical but not natural

> This idea that every connection, so to speak, in the nervous system would be encoded by a specific molecular interaction gave rise to a lot of problems. That is, he calculated the number of synapses in the nervous system and showed they were vastly in excess of the number of base pairs in the DNA let alone the genes. But that was naive because it strongly underestimated the power of combinatorics.
>
> I didn't believe in it, because it assumed the prime numbers existed in nature, that's one of the reasons I didn't believe in it. It is that that I think is so important in trying to make theories, is that they should always contain some biochemical plausibility – some **biological plausibility** – estimate. **Many theories are correct in a logical sense but they're untrue because they don't refer to the natural thing we're all interested in.**

---

## 165. We must be careful when making analogies in science

> One of the things I did during that time but never published, was to try and calculate what was the reliability of biological machines. Von Neumann had shown that you could build reliable machines out of unreliable components, but these machines are very big, and the question is: can you shrink them? And in fact of course that was what he showed; you can't shrink them below certain limits, otherwise the noise starts to interfere.
>
> But I think **we should suspect these easy analogies because they are likely to be wrong, because these analogies operate in our conscious minds which are very restricted**. You know, we like to think of the nervous system as something like a general sending commands to an army. You know, there's a general here and he's got captains and he's got lieutenants and he's got sergeants and he's got private soldiers, and this hierarchical structure seems to be the way that we think about command structures and administrative structures. But this may not be the way organisms actually operate. And I think that we've got to be very careful about the analogies we import from our conscious experience into our biology.

## 166. A meeting with the President of the British Computing Society

> I never forget that I was once asked whether I would meet a man who was the President of The British Computing Society, and I said, sure, and he came up and we had lunch together in Cambridge. He says, 'I've been dying to meet you because we're interested in writing programs for banks. What we'd like to know is how does the biological system perform all these complicated things? Maybe there's some clues to us for programming'.
>
> I said, 'You know, I'm really delighted to meet you because I'm interested in how do these biological systems do all these complex things, and I thought well, maybe if I studied some complex programs for banks I would get some clues to explaining this'. So **we both departed in great mutual ignorance, which is the best way**.
>
> But I think this sort of thing did spark off an interest in my... of mine, which I still have, which is questions of the **theory of elaborate systems**, which I've never had time to work on properly. But I think there is... I mean, the first question about... in this field is: **is there a theory of elaborate systems?** I'm afraid I can't answer that yet, but I think there is a style of thinking that one has to use which escapes very much what, what we can do in, in our normal thought processes.

---

## 167. The importance of conversation for science

> The lab in Cambridge was absolutely the most marvellous place to work in because one would do a different thing almost every hour. I had an office which I shared with Francis, had shared this office with him since I came to Cambridge. We lived together in the, the old hut at the, at the Cavendish, in... till 1962, when we moved up to Hills Road, to the new lab.
>
> And what we had done in the new lab was to equip it with blackboards. We still liked chalk and blackboards. We had one blackboard in our old little office, but we acquired lots of them. There were three altogether. And **on this blackboard we would meet, often every day, and talk about everything**. We could talk about an experimental result and say what could this possibly mean? Or Francis would tell me he's just read this paper, these are his views about it.
>
> And what was very interesting is that we pursued very... very different, divergent paths, we... but came together for these discussions. The Americans in our lab always wanted journal clubs or formal discussion groups. I've never been in favour of this. And I tell them if they want it, they organise it themselves, I'm not going to organise it.
>
> I did for a year, form something called **the SB Educational Society**, in which everybody was told with 5 minutes' notice, that they had to come and tell me what they were doing to educate me. This again also wasn't liked by the Americans, who required time for preparation of what they had to say. But it seemed to me **if you had to prepare anything on what you were doing at the moment you'd better get worried about that, because it means you don't know what you're doing**.
>
> However, those... the other very informal discussion group was known as **the Saturday morning coffee**. In the lab we congregated in the kitchen, the sterilising kitchen on the second floor, where we made coffee on a Saturday morning. And there people came from all over the lab, and at the coffee there, would discuss everything: molecular structure, embryology, psychology, sometimes politics, just anything.
>
> But there were many, many interesting discussions there, and I feel **this kind of ongoing conversation is so important to science**. It's important because I'm not the sort of person that likes to think in, in isolation. There are a number of people I know who go away and cook up a whole theory and then come and do it. I don't. I think a lot of what's beneficial is by conversation, because **an idea usually forms in my mind, it's at least 50% wrong the first time it appears**. There's something wrong with it. And it's only in playing with it, if I can call it that, that you can refine it and see what its essential things.
>
> And I believe that interaction is... is sort of part of the great joys of science, of suddenly saying, gee, you know, I actually got it wrong the first time, now I can see it. And of course the other great joy is to be able to convert that into an experiment, then go and do the experiment and get the answer.

## 168. The freedom to work without short-term justification

> The whole of the *C. elegans* project wasn't anything like the science I'd done earlier. It took a long time to mature, and I don't think we could have done it in the environment that requires short-term justification for anything.
>
> **Being able to work without this endless justification that is common today**... the endless thing just saying... which I feel is completely stifling to creative work in science... I think made that subject. The Medical Research Council was very supportive of this; they didn't require this endless justification. And I think that's what allowed us to do the kind of work that we did.

## 169. Estimating the genetic complexity of *Caenorhabditis elegans*

> Since we had undertaken in Cambridge to build the kind of infrastructure of the work, that is that we had done the complete anatomy... we would pursue this. But I knew that in fact that one would have to get down to the molecular basis... one of the things that I did was a very early study on *C. elegans*... tried to estimate the number of genes...

## 170. Isolating the gene proteins of the nematodes

> I thought in the early '70s we should start to do molecular biology. And that meant isolating gene products. And so we thought, well, we'll start with something that we know about. It turned out that a lot of our mutants were paralysed. And a large number of these mutants had defective muscles. That we could see in the electron microscope.
>
> Since a muscle, as anybody who eats meat knows, is the major portion of many animals, it means their proteins were highly abundant, and to a biochemist that's very reasonable. So I said well **let's see if any of these genes correspond to the structural proteins of muscle**. Those were known because there were a whole group of people called muscle biochemists that had isolated actin, myosin, tropomyosin and so on, and we thought well, let's see if any of our genes control this and then we can start.
>
> Later on, we'll come to the genes that control the production of this, but are these structural genes? So we developed methods for growing large quantities of nematodes, and **we actually grew them like you grow bacteria**. What we did is we grew fermenters of bacteria, then we threw in nematodes and they ate all the bacteria and so we would then harvest the nematodes.
>
> And that enabled us to isolate from these animals reasonable quantities of these proteins and begin the long job of finding out which of these mutants corresponded to this. And of course one of the ones we found out is that there was a gene apparently which we'd studied extensively called **unc-54**, which apparently controlled a major component of the body musculature — the heavy chain of myosin.
>
> And a lot of our work then turned, partly to looking at other genes in this, and later we found, Bob Waterston found that another gene controlled — unc-15 — controlled the specification of another protein called paramyosin. And it became very clear in working through this, and by... we were able to prove that that was the structural gene and not another gene that told another gene to make myosin, because we found that physical changes in myosin modif... were specified by the same gene.

## 171. 'Leaky' mutants may give clues to the evolution of development

> The mutants of the nervous system, I started to look at very early on, and found that many of those that were not muscle mutants had very large deviations in the organisation of their neurones. That is, we could find differences very easily. Now, of course what you would hope for is that you could find a very specific difference, so that you could identify a process that corresponded to this gene. And many of the mutants, all we could say is they made a mess.
>
> And the interesting thing is **how many of them made the same mess, and how many of them made a mess which was different in this**. And of course we could find various classes of this, so we found one we found a number of mutants that made exactly the same mess, every time. And then of course another mutant made different messes in different organisms.
>
> And during this time and again it's not something that has been ever formalised anywhere but you can ask yourself is the genetic program in very general terms, say build this, build this, build this, build this? Or does it come or does it say well, there's a big part that says build this, build a sort of a leg, and then we have all this tinkering that goes that goes on which evolution has added, to build a proper leg, an accurate leg? And one's guess is that **there will be sort of leg programs and there will be a second level which will be called refining programs**.
>
> So evolution might actually be viewed as, you know, **one step backwards, two steps forward in another direction**. However, that's the sort of thing that that I think will eventually emerge as we understand these programs.

---

## 172. Analysis of epistasis within nematodes

> By the early years of the '70s the nematode program had become established. Genetics — the basic genetics — had been done and there were now many people exploring other mutants and analysing them in the same way. The anatomy was slowly being completed, and of course many people were looking for systems that they could begin to exploit.
>
> And many people came to the lab, isolated various mutants, mapped them and then began to do complementation with them. Apart from looking at the structural changes we could analyse these mutants by putting them in combinations, the so-called **analysis of epistasis**. Namely if you put two mutations together and the phenotype was like A, then it meant that B had no extra effect and therefore acted after A. And so one could then analyse what came to be called **genetic pathways**.
>
> But the core of it, and it worried me all the time, was **how on earth would one ever get down to finding the molecules involved in regulation?** If there are proteins like Jacob-Monod, that recognised DNA, and if any of our mutants affected these, how on earth would we actually prove this?

---

## 173. The C paradox inspires Francis Crick to ideas about regulation

> In early '70s Francis got interested in... had been interested in some time, and we both got very interested... and he in particular after he went to a meeting, in what was called **the C paradox**. And this was that it appeared that higher organisms had more DNA than they should reasonably have to specify what they were doing.
>
> It used to be said that people were divided into three classes: those, there were the physicists who believed that organisms had... didn't have enough DNA to do what physicists thought were very complicated things; there were the smart molecular biologists who thought that organisms just had exactly the right amount of DNA that they needed; and there were a group of people who were really concerned with what this extra DNA was required for.
>
> And one day Francis came in very excited, he'd been to a meeting, and he said, 'I've got a new idea and I think that **regulation must be carried out by... by single stranded nucleic acid**'. So, you have the idea that higher organisms would have to do a lot of regulation, they require what is called the versatility of control. They'd have to recognise rather longer stretches of DNA, and you can't do that with a protein, this was the idea.
>
> At least it had the clarity that **if the axiom was wrong everything else would have to be wrong**, as I pointed out to him.

---

## 174. Dispute over the repetitive DNA in *Caenorhabditis elegans*

> We had been doing experiments on *C. elegans*... exploring the nature of repetitive DNA and its significance in nematode development.

---

## 175. Extra DNA is kept like junk, not thrown out like garbage

> A lot of it was conditioned by one experimental result found in drosophila about bands and interbands, and it looked like one band contained one gene. This is a great mapping experiment. We now know what bands and interbands are, because the idea was the band or the interband was the control region.
>
> But Francis did write a paper on the structure of the eukaryotic chromosome in 1971, which embodied this deductive theory of... of this, and I think it was completely wrong and, and not the right thing to do. I mean, it was an interesting paper, but it, it rested on such shaky assumptions it could be easily demolished, like versatility of regulation which needn't be too versatile if you have 'don't care' conditions.
>
> I wrote a paper myself trying to... which essentially just accounted for it as **junk**. That is not liked, is still not liked very much, because I think people feel very uncomfortable with the idea that a lot of their DNA is of no value. Not to them and not to anybody. And I think we have to get beyond the sort of psychology to really appreciate what are the forces in evolution that say junk can be kept or not kept as the case is made.
>
> I mean, my only contribution to the junk subject is to differentiate, to make a strong differentiation between **junk and garbage**. Because very clear is **junk is the rubbish you keep and garbage is the rubbish you throw out**. So extra DNA by definition cannot be garbage, but only junk, because if it were garbage it wouldn't be there. And I think that's essentially the answer, because **junk is just garbage that there's no need to throw out**.

---

## 176. A new technique to get down to the molecular basis

> Having got to this stage of — in the early '70s — of extensive analysis of the genetics of this beast, an extensive amount of work on the biochemistry beginning, the anatomy going ahead, the development going ahead, the whole of... techniques of knocking out neurones by laser abrasion, knocking out cells by laser abrasion and having a way of studying development, **one felt the ship was, was at sea but it was very unclear where it was heading**.

---

## 177. Inserting nematode DNA into *Bacillus subtilis*

> I had an experiment which Francis dissuaded me from doing, which was to see if nematode genes would work in bacteria... I invented a unit for it called **an Av**.

---

## 178. Using my invented unit - Av - in an experiment

> I invented a unit which was an Av. **An Av of events was 6 x 10²³ events**. So for example, a milli-Av was 6 x 10²⁰, and a micro-Av was 6 x 10¹⁷. And I thought that I could go down to perhaps a nano-Av, by using big vats of culture. But certainly I could look at about 10¹³ events. Which is of course just slightly under a nano-Av.
>
> And of course now we know that **experiment wouldn't had a hope in hell of working**. No, not a chance. Zero. For the simple reason, these nematode genes have introns in them. The... the bacterium wouldn't have known what to do with them. I mean, you know, apart from all the other barriers for transfer, which we now know about, host-induced modification wouldn't have had a thing.
>
> So Francis talked me out of it. He was quite right, because I thought it was, you know, **the last desperate experiment**.

---

## 179. The beginning of controversy in genetic manipulation

> Paul Berg came to the lab and he asked me about advice on an experiment that he was trying to do with SV40... This marked the beginning of discussions about the safety and ethics of genetic manipulation experiments.

---

## 180. My predictions of synthesising at the Ashby commission

> I think it was August 1974... September, I received a letter from the secretary of the MRC [Medical Research Council] enjoining me not to do any of these experiments because of the moratorium which was very easy to obey, because I suddenly realised the great merit of something I had discovered very early, which is **the difference between chastity and impotence**. So we didn't have to be chaste, we were impotent to do anything. So of course we could agree to the moratorium immediately.
>
> But I could see that in fact this, this needed to be got into... into the work. However, we lived in a time now where these things had to be handled very carefully. In this country we set up the Ashby Commission, and I gave evidence to the Ashby Commission and I had the chance to look at my evidence again a few months ago, because I felt quite certain that I'd remembered saying something which people denied, but of course it is there.
>
> What I predicted they... nobody would cloning all these genes, **they would be synthesising them**. And I predicted that in fact people would synthesise the gene for insulin. And the gene for insulin would be put into a plasmid and that would be produced as a thing. Now that was pooh-poohed at the time, because you see, it raised the question which no one was willing to ask about, was if a... if your gene carries the danger from the organism that it comes from, what the hell is an insulin gene, a synthetic insulin gene? **It's a piece of chemistry**.

---

## 181. Suggesting 'The Book of Man' at the Asilomar Conference 1975

> At Asilomar, where I gave a talk — and again the recording of the talk exists there — I had in fact suggested something called **the Book of Man**. You have to realise that at that time we still did not know that genes contained introns. And what I'd thought was we would take all the genes and we would glue them down on a page of nitrocellulose and this would be the Book of Man and you could turn to page 48, line 23, word four, and there you'd have the gene for serum albumin written there. And so the concept that one could just get the genes by working with DNA was of course very much alive and of course being in Cambridge where Fred Sanger was sequencing DNA, realised that **this is on the threshold of the new genetics**. And the new genetics is then what I became extremely interested in.

---

## 182. The influence of the press at the Asilomar conference 1975

> I hadn't realised in America how much things had changed. What you... what people have to recall, and I recalled this just recently very much with the death of... with the recent death of Nixon, was that **the press had actually got rid of a president of the United States**. And organisations like *The Washington Post* were unbelievable in their... in their dreams of omnipotence.
>
> At that meeting, which had been sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences, it had been agreed that certain speakers could ask for the recording to be turned off while they said something. And the National Academy would then turn off the record, so they could speak off the record. And the question was put to the audience, would the press turn off their machines at the same time? And we were asked to vote on this, that the press turn off their machines if someone asked that this be off the official record.
>
> And when they took a vote, **I was the only one who voted for it**. I think there was one other European. But everybody else didn't vote for it. And when at the press conference I was asked by the reporter from *The Washington Post*... how dare I come to this country, this is a free... you know, we have freedom of the press and so on, how dare do I come and suggest that the press should be turned off? I said well, look it was the only case where I was given an opportunity of commenting on the presence of the press and I voted this way because I'm dead against the press being here.
>
> Well, the man went berserk, you know. Sort of accused me as a fascist and so on, and then he said: 'Why do you have to do this?'. I said because **I believe in the inalienable right of adult scientists to make fools of themselves in private**, you see. Eventually when talking to them, that whole atmosphere in America which we take as now given, that you don't do things without... without these concerns — as the Americans say — reaching you, was something that was totally... totally, you know, changed completely in the injection of this into the public... into the public atmosphere.

---

## 183. Is Lion DNA more dangerous than pussycat DNA?

> In America they'd become very anxious in getting a licence to do this work, so they would settle on anything as long as they got a licence. So we... so an enormous system of categories got invented, and which had been worked out by scientists and which was ludicrous because the dangers — and all the dangers were conjectural, that is you thought they were dangers — were **dependent on where the DNA came from**, all right. So, clearly malaria is a dangerous disease. Therefore they said if you clone malaria you have to do this under a high category, without taking into consideration what it would take to reconstitute malaria from its component DNA molecules.
>
> On that grounds, you see, **you would have to clone lion DNA at a much higher category than, say, pussy cat DNA**, because clearly lions are more dangerous than pussy cats. And so this kind of uncanny never-neverland which... which just made no sense of anything became the way in which one did these experiments over the next few years.

---

## 184. Scientists and social responsibility

> Well, this period where one was trying to get... the science going because one realised that this was the important thing for solving many of the problems in biology, was I think, difficult all over the world, and I spent an inordinate amount of time working in the field and also trying to change things. In this country they set up a committee called the Genetic Manipulation Committee, it had lots of representatives, and we got a workable system. But one of the things that became perfectly obvious after all of this had got established was that **no one actually believed it was dangerous**. And it is very difficult to get people to play at being safe when they know it's... they can't... they cannot see what would come out of this. I mean, everybody knows that if you work with smallpox virus you can get it, or the AIDs virus, you can get it. There have been laboratory infections. But to say that this... this DNA cloned from this organism is dangerous was actually beyond scientific belief.
>
> Many of the objections to this... there were realistic things which covered what we could call the workforce in the laboratory. And in fact we chose actually to push everything in that direction because that was something tangible and you could actually get... get moving in that field.
>
> Well, what I thought was very difficult to deal with is something that I think comes up with science in general and is impossible, namely **the disaster scenarios, the catastrophe scenarios**. Someone like Chargaff came out and said: 'You are tampering with evolution and we don't know what's going to happen'. Now, I mean, how on earth can you ask scientists to be responsible for something that might happen 10 million years in the future? I mean, this is ludicrous, people can't actually be responsible for something that will happen next month. But the whole idea that we should say, yes, we can see that if we do this there is a possibility, however small, as they put it, that in 10 million years we humans will be supplanted by cats and therefore we'd better not do it. This... this is just not the way to deal with the world, or with science, for that matter.
>
> It also had very complicated issues about the so-called **responsibility of scientists**, which I've never believed. I think that what people should do is in fact to act as in fact good social... people, as individuals, but as a group scientists seem to me to not to have some special social responsibility. And of course that has... came from the atom bomb. But in studying the history there, once you open Pandora's Box, so the argument goes, then everything gets let loose. Therefore the argument is never let the scientists open Pandora's Box. That is, kill it in the laboratories. Because once it's out, society is... is incompetent or unable to deal with it. But that means that... I mean, I once gave a lecture on **the social irresponsibility of society**, because that seems to me to be the issue behind that.
>
> The people, as I said in this lecture, the people polluting the universe aren't the scientists but everybody's mother in the audience, you know, with detergents and so on. And how does everybody's mother get hold of detergents? That's because there are companies who manufacture this, and of course it is a possibility that for the chap that first synthesised dodecyl... dodecyl sulphonate, had he had the sense to envisage in the future that there would be 10 million people putting this in their dishwashers, he might have said, well I'd better not publish this, and better not let it out because I can see, you know, a hundred years' time everything will... will be... will be wrong.
>
> So I mean, this kind of... this kind of thing just makes it ludicrous. And the important thing is that **science I think is neutral in that sense. If the box can be opened it will be opened. If not now, then later. If not by us, then by other people.** And the only thing to do is to forbid the search for any new knowledge. You can't just forbid the search for that kind of new knowledge and not for any other kind, because it's part of the process. Now it seems to me that people had better get on to the real question, which is what do you do with it once you get it? And it's not up to us to say, we are to blame, *mea culpa*, we'll stop doing this, we promise we'll never clone another gene. Because I mean, you would lose a lot from this, as we've now known.

---

## 185. Testing possible safe strains on myself

> Part of my work became to really try to get the science moving. And one of the things I did was I created **a safe strain**. And I had a very amusing time with this, because I in fact did propose what our scientists could do is create safe strains. And in fact if we put the DNA into this, they couldn't get out. And so I first conceived of the safe strain; my argument was **I would train a bacterium to live in heavy water**. And that once I got it accustomed to live in heavy water it wouldn't be able to live anywhere in the present universe, because heavy water was only invented in 1935 in Chicago. Invented, I mean, obtained in pure form.
>
> So I've actually grown... I actually grew bacteria for thousands of generations in heavy water. They adapted and there's quite an interesting story in evolution there still to... to come to its fruition, but alas they could always grow back in light water. But I would have thought that would be the absolutely safe strain, that it would only know this kind of particular chemical universe. It would have made the work very expensive and people like the Norwegian Electricity Company very rich because everybody would have had to use heavy water.
>
> But I did create a safe strain. It taught me a lot of lessons about this whole technology, because it's extremely difficult to do genetic engineering. Everybody thinks you just kind of toss it off and everything works. **It's extremely difficult to attain an end on this. Most of the time it's like the television set, it doesn't work. If you tamper with a television set you tend to break it most of the time rather than do something new.**
>
> And so we finally did create a thing and I had to test it. And of course **I tested it on myself**. Now, as you know, human experimentation is strictly forbidden, and so I said I'm testing it on an upper primate, I didn't say it was a human being. In fact I don't count myself necessarily as one. I was then told I should consult people before I did this experiment. They couldn't stop me, but I should consult people. So I sort of met odd people in the street and said what do you think about this? However, I did the experiment; it was a very good experiment. I put... I showed my safe... my strain was **10 million times safer**.

---

## 186. Cloning viruses to make them safer to work with

> The best case to take a dangerous virus is to take it and clone it; that would make it safe. And put it in *E. coli*.

---

## 187. A big danger in genetic manipulation: Shiga toxin and *E. coli*

> Another remarkable lesson that emerged was, don't worry, **if you can think of something dangerous, nature's probably done it**. And one of the most dangerous things we could think of, because the idea was think of something that's practically dangerous and then see how you would deal with it. So I surmised of taking cholera toxin and putting it in *E. coli* (*Escherichia coli*) so that delivers the toxin to the right place, in a vector that can infect other bacteria, and that I considered a dangerous experiment, and then showed how one would cope with this.
>
> Well, it's been done befo... it's been done. It's called **Shiga toxin**. This is in fact the same kind of toxin as cholera toxin, it exists in a bacteriophage related to the common bacteriophage that we use in our laboratories – Lambda. This bacteriophage infects a *Shigella* bacterium, which is quite closely related to the common *E. coli*. And that's how **nature has done it before. And of course always has priority over us**.
>
> Well, having spe... I spent an inordinate amount of my time on this. And I think it was basically required in the sense that if people who were sensible had not done, then had not participated in this process we would have been left in some of the difficulties say, that they have in Germany today where it's extreme... it's impossible to do genetic experimentation. Or in parts of Japan as well, where it's impossible to do this kind of experimentation.

---

## 188. The two eras of developmental biology: Before Cloning and After DNA

> During this time of course we got into *C. elegans*, began to clone genes and we cloned the muscle genes and sequenced them, and of course then this opened up in the late '70s, early '80s in fact, the whole of the current activity in finding out about eukaryotic cells. So the whole of developmental biology just changed totally.
>
> In fact, I wrote an article for a journal — a Trends journal — which was for its 10th anniversary. I think I wrote it in the... about '80... '84 and what I wrote there was that in the history of biological science we can think of **two epochs**, okay. **BC, which stands for Before Cloning and AD, which stands for After DNA**. Because at that junction, which dates back now 20 years, 1975... before that point everything seemed hopeless, we'd never get down to the molecular biology of these genes.
>
> And now I mean, it's banal. It's commonplace. Everybody can do it, they can clone a gene, they can sequence it, they can say does this look like something I've seen before, and how can I fit this in? So this has clearly opened up large areas of biology to everybody. And there's no doubt about it, that **the explosion of this has made developmental biology into a science**.

---

## 189. Dealing with the monsters above and the idiots below

> As the '70s approached, I then made another big mistake in my life, which is **I became the director of the laboratory**. That I think I… I did out of some kind of loyalty to the institution. In fact, I became the director elect some two years before I took it over, in 1977, because the lab had tremendous financial difficulties. It hasn't… it wasn't really properly funded and its organisation was… was okay when there was lots of money, but once the money began to shrink in the boundaries it wasn't okay. And I mean, it was just ludicrous to work in a lab where you… you run out of methanol. I mean, there just isn't… there isn't any money to buy any methanol. And you have to, you know, there's no way you can do this.
>
> And so I took over the budget of the lab in '77 when I was made Director Elect, and I then became the Director in '79 – 1979. And I think that doing that was at least in my… as I look back on it, I think that was a big mistake, because it's not, it's not a thing that I really like doing. And I realise that **people who go into these positions become like windows**, that is, where the people above them look through them at the people below them and **you become a mediator between two impossible groups, namely the monsters above and the idiots below**.

---

## 190. Resigning as director and renewing my interest in the nervous system

> I had become interested in the nervous system again, in which I thought the most interesting thing to do would be to use the new technology to start to find out what the genes were doing in brains like our own or... the organism I chose was chickens simply because they were experimentally approachable. And I did start some work with this, and I had the ideas of trying to set up some **molecular neurobiology** at the time. And those didn't mature for various reasons.
>
> And I then decided that when I was approaching my 60th birthday — the MRC [Medical Research Council] had only appointed me director till 60 — so at 58 they asked me do you wish to continue? And I said: 'No, I don't wish to continue as director, because **I want to get out, back to do science**'. And I managed to get out a year later, 1986, and I started another unit. And I decided... already I had decided that I would be interested and... and work in **the new genetics**.

---

## 191. Links between the Human Genome project and *Caenorhabditis elegans*

> **The new genetics can be differentiated from the old genetics because here we go from the genes outwards** rather than in the old genetics we went from the phenotype inwards to look for the genes. And I had made contact with the people that were interested in starting the Human Genome Programme. In fact, when Bob Sinsheimer had his first meeting in 1984, I couldn't go to that and sent two people from the lab. But they had a repeat of that in '85 at Santa Fe and I went to that. And I simply believed that this was going to be the new way of doing biological science and it would open up enormous vistas to us. So the Human Genome Project, as it is called, became a central interest of mine.
>
> I had been interested in genomic studies in the sense that I realised that once you could clone DNA you could map it in some way. And I spent, it's now nearly 20 years, trying to work out a simple way of doing this that would be logistically able so that someone could **make a map of a higher organism on the kitchen table**, basically. I'm not there yet, I'm nearly there.
>
> And we started doing work on bacteria to try to map these. That got quite far, John Sulston joined me in this bacteria mapping, and then he decided he would try and apply the technology we developed to *C. elegans*. And the *C. elegans* project then grew into an enormous genome project which is now with aims of sequencing the entire genome.
>
> I decided that I would go for the human genome. Now, the reasons for that is that I think if we've got to do this amount of work on an animal, one animal, then let's choose the animal that's of most interest. And from this egocentric point of view I think man is extremely interesting. The point is that **you are no longer conditioned by experimental constraints**. When we did classical experimental genetics we had to go through endless selections to get an organism that fitted into the window of the electron microscope, or that would grow rapidly in a laboratory, or that and that you could freeze, and had the appropriate life cycle that you could do experiments with. And this throughout the whole of this made enormous constraints about what you could choose, and that half of the art of choosing was in fact a piece of science in its own right, so that one could get something started in this way.

---

## 192. I am a strong believer in the value of ignorance

> When I started the *C. elegans* [*Caenorhabditis elegans*] I was almost 40 then; many of my colleagues were thinking of retiring, you know, into administration and things like that. In fact, the first mutant was got just before my 41st birthday, so I was 40 when we got the first mutant. And I worked in *C. elegans* for — extensively and personally — for... for another 10 years, having started it way back in 1963. And of course I then decided to give it up.
>
> Well, that's simply because there were lots of people doing it and they were far more competent at doing what needed to be done than I was. I mean, we did continue till the early '80s, but basically my mind was going somewhere else.
>
> The main reason is that... **Bernal once said that people in science... he compared science to a chess game**. And he said there's the opening game, there's the mid game, middle game, and the end game. Of course, very few people get a chance to play the end game, and most people are in the middle game. But **I find the most wonderful thing in science is the opening game**, when everything's... there's nothing else there and that's when I think you can exercise also a tremendous amount of freedom of choice, and freedom of intellectual choice as well. Bernal himself was extremely good at the opening game. And I think that's the challenge, and so having played the opening game with *C. elegans*, and it was now in the middle game where there were lots of people, you know, taking pawns and moving knights around the board, I thought: better go and find somewhere else to play another game.

> And that's essentially what I've done, and of course you might think that in effect... I did think that the age of nearly 60 was probably not a good time to start science, but in fact it is. I like to think that people who... who get to be the age of 60 already know too much about the subjects they've worked in at any stage to be of any use to it. Because **I've always been a strong believer in the value of ignorance**. And so, therefore, I think that when you know too much you're dangerous in the subject because you will deter originality in others. And therefore, **the big thing is to get out of it and go and look for something else to do**.
>
> And also, when you get to the age of 60, it's very useful, you begin to forget things, and so, therefore, your knowledge is decaying all the time. And that's also quite useful. It's, it's also quite dangerous in fact, because you find yourself doing things that you did actually 15 years ago and forgot about and actually go through it again and rediscover it. So that, I think, is the, is the interesting thing, that's why I think **people should change their subjects very frequently**, and why I think the best scientists do that.

## 193. Wanting a new and challenging problem to study

> The choice of the problem to work on — after we thought that all the general outline of molecular biology had been accomplished — that was one of the things that Francis and I started talking about in the early '60s. Our view was that the main outlines were known, and that it only remained to... to populate the various areas of the subject, and we were sure that that would be done with a vengeance.
>
> And so when we sat down to discuss... what are the next challenging problems in biology, we quickly discarded problems in molecular biology that we thought needed solution. Certainly at that time, although the outlines... were known, nothing was really known about the detailed mechanisms of protein synthesis. And in 1962 there still remained a tremendous task to understand the structure and function of the ribosome, to understand transfer RNA, to understand how activating enzymes work. And you could have written a program if you wanted to, which would involve a huge study of, let us say, the ribosome and the mechanism of protein synthesis. And that would involve purifying ribosomes, trying to crystallise them, getting all their protein components, sequencing all the proteins, getting all the transfer RNAs, separating them, finding all the activating enzymes and reducing it then to the molecular level.
>
> And **that we thought we didn't want to do**, although our laboratory, our institute at that... point had all the capability of doing it. If you like, **that was a kind of project research** in which you could... a general could, so to speak, plan a campaign and then just get, you know, the cavalry to do this and the artillery to do that. And **that didn't seem to me to be what one wants to do in science**.
>
> There was of course at the time also a... a great feeling that it was essentially all over. This was about the time that Gunther Stent had written this famous paper, the rough... I forget its title, but it used to be called by us *The End of Molecular Biology*. It was part of a more general thing that he wrote, which was *The End of Everything* [sic], basically.
>
> But one felt that **one had to go to problems that I think were challenging**, and my view was that we had to go back to the problems that faced Thomas Morgan.

## 194. Thomas Hunt Morgan and *Drosophila*

> Thomas Morgan was an embryologist — Thomas Hunt Morgan — who had worked at the turn of the century in many subjects and had discovered that he'd come to the end of what he could do with classical embryological techniques. And this is why in the beginning of the century he turned to genetics, because he thought that in genetics he would learn something, have a different approach to developmental biology, which he just felt had, had reached, a dead end.
>
> And of course he established *Drosophila* as an experimental organism, and *Drosophila* had this 50 years... growth and development and one felt, well, **now one's come to the end of the genetic deviation and one must go back to the problems of biology that had been left behind, namely those of development**.

---

## 195. How to study development?

> When one discussed development, at that stage you couldn't really tackle something like development. You could say I'm interested in development or I'm interested in the nervous system, but nobody actually knew how you could do it. The classical technology, if I can put it, of development, was essentially **cut and splice**. You take a piece out of an embryo at one point and… at one part and you move it around to another part. And I can remember that… and of course you either note whether it changes or it doesn't change. If it alters, that is, takes up the properties of its new environment, then we call it that it's been regulated, and it wasn't determined. And a whole language had been developed, which I can remember reading through in the '40s with… with people, with Joe Gilman, reading… Needham's book, the *Biochemistry and Morphogenesis*, and being totally involved in really very detailed discussions on the difference between evocation and induction. It was tremendously hard to discover whether induction and evocation were really two different things or was one part of the other. And whether an evocator was something different from an inducer, and so on. And so we had no other approach then to cut and splice.
>
> Of course what we knew is, that we now had genes to contend with. We knew what they are. We knew that genes made proteins, and so that just said, well, let's get started in… into this and look at how genetics or genes will now affect our knowledge of embryology.
>
> I have to say also that the biochemical approach to development had totally fizzled out. The search for the inducer had gone on, lots of people had tried, there were lots of things that… that had worked. There were, there was a huge area of biochemistry in development which simply consisted in assaying enzymes in eggs and in tadpoles, and the… the connections weren't there. There was a lot of what I would call theoretical work, in fact a few books written by Waddington at the time on organisers and genes — a very interesting book — and ideas that genes really control rate processes, but **all of this had no body in it, it lacked… it lacked a material content and was simply verbalising our ignorance**.
>
> And having… and the way that I think Francis and I worked is that I kept on thinking is, what… what experimental system would one attempt to do this? And I remember saying well, what we should do is **decompose the problems of development into sub-problems**, and just see whether we can tackle these problems in an experimental way independently, because **the global problem is intractable at this time**. And we then decided to ask what were the questions that you could decompose it into. So one of the questions was that… cell movement, it had become clear that I mean, cells move around and that cell movement may be an important thing in modelling… modelling the organs of… of animals. Polarity, which I think is still a very important problem, was in my mind the essential problem. You had to explain why one part of a cell became different from another. Why certain cells divided with certain planes of division, which of course one could see from all the classical descriptive embryology that polarity, I think, needed this explanation.

## 196. How do genes control development?

> Nobody seemed to be very interested in connecting up development with the genes. There was a complete gap between these. And when people began to think about this and began to think that perhaps genes... how, in what sense could genes be considered the units of development, it became clear that that was a non-question. **The units of development are cells. And our job is to ask how do genes get hold of the cells**, if I can put it in that way. Because that's the way the genes must go through to the developmental process, and indeed to all the complex phenotypes of organisms. They have to get hold of the construction machinery of these... of the organs in order to express their effects.
>
> However, the gradients was very interesting, because what impressed Francis is that he made a quick calculation about the sizes of these things. He didn't know the sizes of imaginal discs, so he quickly looked them up, and he made a calculation which is really what Francis is very good at, as to whether **diffusion of an average sized small molecule could account for the results** because that would... could only operate at a certain scale. That is, it would be very hard... it would take too long to establish something by diffusion if, let us say, it was 10 feet wide. And you wouldn't want to do this if it was just, let us say, 100Å. But this was in the scale of sizes that... that could be done by diffusion.
>
> And so Francis got very interested in asking whether you could account for positional information that Lewis was discussing in terms of a process of diffusion. So one had a very simple model then which was that one had a... a source — that is some cells that created this soon became a **diffusible morphogen** — and you had a sink at the other end and this molecule distributed itself at a... in the form of a gradient across this. And then the idea was that **the cells would read this gradient and decide what it is they were going to be**. And so you had a lot of discussions as to whether... of course you then had to have set a threshold in each of the groups of cells and of course you can ask how accurate you can do this.

## 197. Digital and analogue analogies

> It is a remarkable fact, but I actually owned a copy of **Turing's paper**, which in fact I wrote and got from him when it pub… was published in The Royal Society; because I'd known of course Turing's name from computing, via the von Neumann. But I hadn't realised that he'd done this, so when I saw this… I actually have the copy somewhere. And it's quite interesting because later when he died his mother found my address amongst his papers and she actually wrote to me saying that she'd found this and so on and it is in fact through that and my connection with King's College that I had… I'd got involved in the Turing Trust, because Turing was a fellow of King's and in fact it was through this organisation that we got his life written by Andrew Hodges — the book called *The Enigma* — and which was very, very successful, and I think a very interesting book.
>
> And I had of course looked… I… when I say read, I mean looked at Turing's paper, which of course I wasn't too *au fait* with the equations they did, but they… they were diffusion equations as well. And of course it's a very interesting paper because it's… if you could think of **Turing as being the archdeacon of digital computation**, which he was in his Turing machine and in everything that followed in computers; **this stuff was exactly the opposite. It is essentially an analogue computation**, and that's an analogue computation with thresholds, and the sort of thing that cells are, and objects, are very good at doing.
>
> And of course it is interesting that… that this separation between digital and analogue thinking really swept through biological sciences and I think a lot of the analogue computation was just forgotten, because of the… I think for a lot of things like — computers were digital, genetic programs were like computer programs — it's all this kind of thinking by metaphor or thinking by similarity, by analogy, that I think confused a lot of people. Because **biological systems have worked out extremely good ways of doing analogue computation within their scales**, and do it exceedingly well. And in fact, **they find it very difficult to count things beyond one. They can count the difference between one and nought.**
>
> And so… I think that Turing then had shown that there's an engineering solution, if I can put it that way. And it is interesting that Lewis himself had been trained as an engineer and so this I think did come naturally to him, that this is a… this is the kind of machinery that doesn't count but has thresholds and has flows and… and organises things in that way.

## 198. 'Have A Look' biology

> We thought that biological systems were... were three-dimensional pattern organisations, and of course what we had to do then was to try to ask how did you create patterns in three dimensions? But... we found that in most of the cases that we could look at, **the pattern was really created in two dimensions, and the third dimension was obtained in another way** either by rolling a sheet into a tube or by actually multiplying the cells, so that biological systems were essentially two-dimensional.
>
> And of course at one stage we thought, well, two dimensions is quite hard to deal with. Possibly there exist one-dimensional systems. And so the one-dimensional system that I had remembered again from my reading into strange microorganisms, was a blue-green algae. Namely, there were these algae, *Anabaena* was the name, that the cells divided, and at regular places along this filament little differentiated cells appeared, called heterocysts. And the question is how did something know to be a heterocyst and how did it know to be placed in exactly this way.
>
> There was a group in London that worked on this, a man called Fogg, and I went to see him, and he worked at a thing which I think alas is now defunct, Westfield College, which is in North London, he was a teacher of botany at this place. And so I went to see him to get some cultures of this organism and I grew them. They had to be grown in the light, and indeed, if you broke off the thing, you started with this, and you could actually watch the heterocysts appear.
>
> And I managed to persuade two young men, one Mike Wilcox, who had come to join us and whose work had been in... strictly in molecular biology, he'd been originally trained as a chemist, and then he'd moved into molecular biology. And he wanted to do something different, and so I persuaded him and a theoretician, a young... young algebraic topologist called Graham Mitchison to take a look at this.
>
> Now, I think it's important to... to realise that... that one of the things that we did and which ran through all of our work, and which I think came, at least from my background of always having a microscope around and always having a look, in fact **I had invented something called HAL biology. HAL, that's H-A-L, it stood for Have A Look biology**. I mean, what's the use of doing a lot of biochemistry when you can just see what happened?
>
> This actually stemmed from an experience of mine many years before when I worked on protoplasts. Sol Spiegelman had claimed that when he took ribonuclease and had added these to the protoplasts they stopped making protein. And he thought... he took that as evidence that RNA was involved in protein synthesis. But **I always looked at the protoplasts with a microscope, and when I added ribonuclease they disappeared**, which of course was a very good reason why they stopped making proteins, stopped doing everything. The, the ribonuclease lysed them. Presumably it went in, hydrolysed the RNA and that created some osmotic effect and they blew up.
>
> So I think that one has to be... and so have a look biology did this. And one of the interesting things they did, which of course we kept... we did a lot of was simply, just to look at these filaments as they grew. So that when you got to a certain state you had the entire history of how that state was reached. So instead of looking at filaments at one stage, we looked then at their history, and you could do statistics on the history as well.

## 199. Reading rots the mind

> Francis had one day came and put in the office a rather large text which said ***Reading Rots The Mind***. I think he saw it somewhere and had it enlarged, copied and enlarged and pinned it up there. I don't know what it was intended for, but I think it must have been the very similar to many of the people's quoting to us of Rutherford's famous remark that there are two kinds of science, there is stamp collecting, there is some kinds there is real science, and that's physics, and everything else is stamp collecting. To which I once replied, **well it turns out there are some stamps worth collecting**. It's true most of them aren't interesting.
>
> However, this may have been related to this because **biology was a subject in which you had to read extensively** and in my opinion. That is, there was everything is specific. Animals differ from each other, they differ from plants, their bacteria, the whole diversity of life and the diversity of investigation into this is enormous. And of course I just felt you just had to know a lot, you had to know a lot and especially I think if you were going to do experimental work you had to know a lot about the living world, because **I've always felt that somewhere there is the ideal organism to do the work, and if only we could find it we could cut years out of this**.
>
> I think Francis himself read a lot. I don't know why he put this up, but he didn't want to he wanted I think to say that science is not a scholarly enterprise, which of course embedded, as we were in an ancient university where there were still people writing books on cells by which were just compendia Francis I think wanted to emphasise that you had to think as well. And that was fine. In other words, **reading was not enough**. I agreed with him. Reading's not enough. But **sometimes thinking isn't enough either**, as well, because in the end **it's doing what counts** and so doing is what was our business.
>
> I never took it seriously. I mean, I didn't become a secret reader because of this. I just read all the time. If there was anything on a piece of paper I read it. And of course I spent a lot of time reading this, and it's the one thing I do like, is it's something I I always do and I still do it. I like to go to libraries and browse. I spend a lot of time doing this. At the Scripps I spend two hours every day just going to the library and looking at the journals, just seeing what's there, reading a bit of this or, if I pick up something in *Bone and Joint Surgery*, I like to see what are these people doing. So I spend a lot of time browsing, a lot of time and a lot of time reading.

## 200. How do I deal with a saturated memory?

> The question is do I make notes or do I remember it all? I make notes. I used to remember more than I did, but that's because I think **my memory stores are full**. I don't think my memory's failing me, I've just reached saturation.
>
> In fact, I take this very seriously because some years ago when I was a member of an MRC [Medical Research Council] committee, there were certain papers I refused to read and when people asked me had you read the papers, I said no, and when they said why not, I said **I now divide papers into three classes: those that give me information, those that have no effect, and those that remove information from my head**. And the latter is in this class and I'm... I've got very little left and I'm not going to give it over to rubbish like this.
>
> However, I think that I do remember things, although I can actually remember when my memory first began to fail me, and it was a very interesting thing. Somebody asked me... in fact it was Miranda Robertson asked me: 'who invented interferon?', and I couldn't remember, but the interesting thing is that after a while I said 'It was Abraham'. Now, the interesting thing is that Abraham didn't invent interferon. He invented cephalosporin. The person who invented interferon is Isaacs. Now you will immediately note that **there is a... old connection from enforced study of the Old Testament when I was young, of the connection between Abraham and Isaac**, which just shows you something about how memory is stored. But the immediate connection had been lost there.
>
> I do make notes, I make extensive notes on everything. I travel around and write down things. I play around in the corner of these things. I used to write things on index cards in the old days. I now tend to write them on exercise... in exercise books, which never get completed. I have a lot of exercise books which have references there and then things, and some of these have never been looked at again. Some have actually developed into whole lines of research.
>
> **Szilárd was like this. Szilárd always wrote things in exercise books**, but what was remarkable was **he threw them away as soon as he finished them**. And I can remember sitting in Pasteur Institute where Leo was talking to Mel Cohen and Mel Cohen was telling him everything of his new theories of antibody formation, which Leo wrote down. He came to the end of an exercise book and he threw it in the garbage can and took another one out of his pocket and went on writing.
>
> So... but I kept everything and... and of course in these days where the literature is so enormous, one just can't do it. But I actually read Chemical Abstracts regularly. Yes, and I'd keep little notes with all of these things. This was before the days of copying, that effectively you had to follow the literature in this way.

---

## 201. My collection of journal reprints

> I had an incredible reprint collection. And so did Francis actually. In fact, we put ours together and I've still got it, and this is reprints that go back to — at least in my case — to the mid 1940s and in Francis's later, and they were arranged alphabetically, so you had to know the author. And they are... I've still got all these boxes, it's about **100 boxes of reprints**. I did cull them the other... because... just because of space storage... but they are wonderful because they showed... you had to write for all of these, and... and so they show you... they showed me at any rate what I'd read.
>
> And in fact I had a... I noticed that in Judson's history he referred to this paper of Kurt Stern with an early speculation on coding. Now I drew his attention to that because I had a reprint of this paper which I had got because I was an avid reader of the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine, which of course nobody's ever heard of today and I found this article there and I wrote to Kurt Stern from South Africa, and I got a reprint, and I still have that reprint. So this could... so this is a style that I got accustomed to because in South Africa **that's the only way you could get hold of interesting things to read**.
>
> So reading I think is important, but I think **knowledge is dangerous** and, to... to research. I really think that **a modicum of ignorance is... is absolutely essential**. Because otherwise you don't try anything. And that's why I think in any line of research people can get saturated very quickly because they just know everything. And when a student comes and says, 'Have you, why don't we try this?' you tend to say 'Oh, don't be silly, you know, that'll never work'.
>
> I had a student who did this, was Anand Sarabhai, a very good student, and he came to me one day and suggested an experiment and I said: 'Look, I don't think it'll work, but please go ahead and try it'. So he went down to the cold room and he got two bottles of phage and he crossed them together and **the experiment worked**. Later we calculated what was the probability that those two bottles were at the front of the queue, because he just took the first ones. The probability was about a million, because I think there were 1000 bottles and the chances of getting two there is one over 1000². So it was a million to one. But **he had what we called the luck of the Sarabhais** and so it worked, so after that everybody asked him to choose the bottles, because that was one way of getting your experiments to work.

## 202. Teaching yourself through reading

> In these days, **finding a book that will introduce you to a subject is quite difficult**. Most people today only learn by going to courses, they have to have a course of instruction, they have to have a lecture, they have to go to a summer course, **the whole idea of learning by yourself now is absent**.
>
> I noticed that when I wanted to learn a new subject like computation — the theory of computation — I got a book and read this book until I found **the way to read it, for me**. That is, the author thinks he's got the right way of telling you about the subject, but in fact I find no, **I have to start with chapter seven, then go back and read the first half of chapter one, then go back, then go and read the second half of chapter 10**. And in that way I create my own path through this. And I think that is very important, because it's the way you construct your own knowledge which is important to you.
>
> Francis read a lot; he read all of Hubel and Wiesel's papers. He found it very difficult. He also led... read a lot of the anatomy of the brain. And in fact for the last 30 years, I think, Francis has done very little except read in order to acquire the background to deal with such an immense problem. So perhaps his mind is now rotten.

---

## 203. Working routines: owls and larks

> My routine used to be as follows. When I was young we divided people into **owls and larks**. Owls stayed at the lab till midnight because that's when it seemed young molecular biologists would like to work. And they then went home and came in the next morning at 10 or 11 o'clock. Seymour Benzer was an owl. He always worked till… almost right through the night. But then he slept all day.
>
> **I was both an owl and a lark.** That is, I liked to work late at the lab and then come home, and then quite often go in early: 6 o'clock, 5 o'clock. But as I grew older I had to choose, so these days I'm much more a lark, that is, **I like to get up very early in the morning, when the whole world is asleep, 4.30, 5.00am**, and then I can read, I can work on my computer, I can scribble my little pieces of paper, and I can also do quite a lot of daydreaming there.
>
> And then I used to do my experiments in the lab at that time as well, because then by the time everything came in and all the secretaries and then the usual mess of one's life started, **I'd already finished my day's work**, so I could just relax then and do all this, the rubbish I had to do. So I think that's important, and nowadays of course one has powerbooks and computers that one can carry around with one, and of course I have this, I have a big database in it, and so I spend quite a lot of time doing research as I travel, and in hotel rooms and at home I have my computer and that's all one needs these days.

## 204. My reasons for choosing *Caenorhabditis elegans*

> It's very clear, we were discussing both development and the nervous system as a... as an issue at the time. The nervous system... I had a long interest in, because of... I actually reconstructed a brain of galago when I was a science student in South Africa. We had a good centre of neuroanatomy. I was an extremely good neuroanatomist at the time, because my teachers were neuroanatomists. And so... and with my relationship with Seymour Papert, where I taught him neurophysiology, and I taught neurophysiology in the physiology class, so I was not a novice at this. But **I had no idea at that time how you would connect this up with genes**.
>
> However, why I finally chose an animal was because **animals have nervous systems**... and not choose a plant. Although I have to say just in passing, I was also very interested in *Arabidopsis* and had become a foundation member of the *Arabidopsis Newsletter*, had in fact got some of these plants, grown them, but it seemed to me plants, as I used to say then, were not real animals.
>
> And the nervous system is attractive, it's attractive as part of an animal because it embodies so many things that you feel are not going to have a simple explanation. That is... one felt you can't do this with... you could not explain nervous systems with simple things that you used to explain beta-galactosidase induction. At least that's how it seemed there.
>
> Now, Seymour Benzer was also interested in the nervous system, but he had decided to go from the gene to behaviour. And I know for certain that at a very early stage I did not see that as a feasible issue, just largely on theoretical grounds, but also because I had become very clear that **the units of development were cells, the units of the nervous system were cells**.
>
> And I know this because I recall very clearly a student coming up to me and said: 'Doctor Brenner, what is going to be the next breakthrough in the nervous system?' And I said to him, '**you are 50 years too late, it's already happened, it's called the neuron hypothesis**'. Because of course prior to that people thought that nervous systems were continua and the triumph of actually showing that they were built of nerve cells connected to each other, that was the breakthrough.

---

## 205. Why choose *Caenorhabditis elegans* for gene-behaviour link?

> It is fair to say that **I was not interested in development *per se***. That is, I was not going to start a thing which would begin with a fertilised egg and then go through all the steps and ask about the germ layers and so on, which was the classical style of doing that.
>
> Nor was I interested in... in relegating myself to a secondary problem such as differentiation and ask questions like, why's a pancreas cell different from a liver cell?
>
> **The nervous system is an organ.** It's an organ built out of cells, and you can ask yourself two questions: how does it work? — which is how does it work to generate behaviour — and then you have to ask how do the genes work to build a nervous system?
>
> **The connection between genes and behaviour must go through the construction and performance of a nervous system.**
>
> If you're interested in complexity you have to be interested in development. Your solution will be couched in developmental terms.
>
> The nematodes looked like something in which **lineage would be very important**. Perhaps there was some mechanism here in which when cells divided they actually computed their future fate.
>
> **Gradients would be the analogue way of doing it, and lineage would be the digital way of doing it**, so to speak.

## 206. Are organisms computable by their DNA?

> Question is are... are organisms computable from their DNA? I gave this at a talk which... Heine... Heine Ursprung reminded me of, and in fact it was at a discussion in London of Developmental Society, in which I said that **one day people will be able to compute a mouse from the DNA sequences alone** which I'm told was the most outrageous statement that anybody had ever made at any Developmental Society meeting.
>
> Computable from DNA sequences and some initial conditions. We want to understand how you build... how a mouse is built, you want to build a mouse. **We would understand the algorithm of how the mouse is built, because we could build it.** It's an essential argument... to realise as to the nature of explanation in biology.
>
> If you were a physicist, what you would want to do is to have a set of equations. These equations would... be called almost certainly **the general appendage equation**. You could get wings with feathers, you could get feet with scales, and you could get legs with hair. It is the variables in this equation which determine this.
>
> All the genes have to do is specify that K1 is this. K1 could be the diffusion constant of a small molecule. K2... could be the distance over which it is moved or pumped. We don't have wings with hair on them, and we don't have feet with feathers. This set of equations would... have certain eigenvalues and forbidden areas.
>
> A physicist would then say... well, he can understand it.

## 207. The oldest biological observation

> Richard Feynman once said that the most important thing about matter is that it's built of atoms, and he also then remarked the most important thing about living systems is that they are just parts of matter and that they are built of atoms. But **the most important thing about living system is they've got genes on them**.
>
> And therefore, in my view, **all explanations of living systems have to be couched in that form, in the form of genes**, because it surely must be the oldest observation to mankind, that the first sentient organism would look around him at the natural world and he would note that plants give rise to plants that look like them, that men give rise to other men, that fleas produce fleas; so that **like produces like is the oldest biological observation**.
>
> And of course what science has accomplished is to tell us that this happens because organisms contain genes in them and what the future organism is... is written in this somehow. And **somehow is what we have to explain. We have to say not somehow, but how.** And I think that ultimately, although we may not have to do it in detail, ultimately that has to be the nature of explanation.

---

## 208. We must use the right language when trying to compute behaviour

> I think organisms have to be computed from their DNA sequences, just as we have to compute proteins from its DNA... a protein from its DNA sequence. Now, when I say compute, I... I mean it in the sense of... of a computation, this need not be a calculation but in fact... and we may not even use a... a digital computer, almost certainly we will, because it's a universal computer, when programmed with the right program we could do this.
>
> Now, we have to do it in this way for the simple reason that **this is the only way you can get to the final... the so-called final explanation**. Otherwise we simply have a set of anecdotes, and this is particularly true if we want to go to yet a more complex thing, which is how to account for behaviour, for the operations of the nervous system. If we say what does an animal or a person do in such and such circumstances, we simply make observations of those circumstances, we then try to look at relationships between these and then of course we try to get a predictive theory of behaviour, and in many cases it falls... it... it fails when it becomes a little bit richer because this simple connection is usually too simple... too simple a correlation.
>
> Now, rather than providing an anecdote, roughly speaking, to take each case and have a look; that is if you ask what does this animal do if you give it a cigarette to smoke? Well, you have to give it a cigarette to smoke and see what happens, then you can give an answer to that question. But **there is no end to asking such questions**, so we have what I call **a halting problem in the Turing sense**. There is no end to the number of questions and answers that we may pose about any complex system.
>
> Now, the only way then we could answer those questions without recourse to the system itself — which of course scientists would say is description — is of course to have a computable theory of it, so that if you can ask me that question I will get the theory to produce the answer. We could then go and check that it's correct.
>
> Now, if you have a unique theory that can do this, and I actually don't think that for behaviour this will be attainable in a very general sense, because — that is, from the genes — because I think what we can have is a unique theory about how the nervous system is constructed from the genes, then we have to start from... with nervous systems and then develop theories of how they work. That is why with the *C. elegans* [*Caenorhabditis elegans*] project it became important to specify the wiring diagram and to ask the question **is behaviour computable from the wiring diagram alone** — plus some initial conditions, I should add — because that's a style of answer which is very similar to answering questions about how you build machines, is it computable?
>
> And this I think raises the question of what is considered a proper computation in this sense, and that I think that can be answered very quickly. That is, **it should be in the machine language of the thing being simulated**. That is, if you wish to describe nematode behaviour it should not be in terms of sin(θ), cos(θ), which may well be very good to generate the wavy... the serpentine motion that they have, but must be in terms of neurones and their connections. That is **the machine language of that**.
>
> Just like **the machine language of development is in terms of cells and the recognition proteins they carry on them**, and all the mechanisms they have to process signals. That's the machine language of development. Machine language of development is not gradients and it's not differential equations. So that is... so I just ruled them out instantly as just boring descriptions of what there is in an incomprehensible language, just like sin(θ), cos(θ) is another boring description in an incomprehensible language. So **the machine language of the object is important** and it is, if you like, the task of experimental biologists to define that.

## 209. Biology needs to be an integrative subject

> Many people working in experimental biology simply think that when they've got it all... they've got the long list of components and have it all together, that there will be a blinding insight that will be achieved. And of course one has to disappoint them because **the real task of biology will yet remain to be done, which is the integrative aspect**.
>
> Now, it is to me open to question whether we will be able to encompass an explanation of behaviour within our own, within our own heads, as indeed within the head of one... one person. And so it remains to be seen how this explanation will... will actually be reached. It may be true that there's a computer model somewhere which does this, but **will people feel they understand it?**
>
> Now, I think to answer that question is... it's very difficult because certainly I'll say that people today would... people today, scientists today will say, I don't believe I understand it, right. Now, in the early days of crystallography I noted that **the only person who understood the structure of a given molecule was the person who actually solved that structure**. That is, he had become so familiar with the detail of it, and he had become so recognising of all the problems that were there in putting it together that he fully understood it. So **Max Perutz was the only person who understood the structure of haemoglobin**. And David Phillips was the only person who understood the structure of lysozyme at one point, right.
>
> Now of course we have hundreds of these structures and if you were to ask a molecular biologist, anybody today, what do you think, do we understand the structure of protein molecules? He'll say- sure. Why? He won't say- he'll... he'll agree we don't understand how they fold up, but we understand... but he'll say we understand the structure. Why? Because he's somehow become convinced by this demonstration over and over again that if you get a crystal and stick it into a machine, the machine gives you all these spots, you can take these spots and take them through another machine, then get these beautiful coloured drawings that are published, these models. Then you can go and buy computer programs or you can get access to these models, and some of them are printed, pictures of them are printed, you can look at them in 3-D, and you can have the feeling that is... so what we need, I think, is **confidence in the kind of conceptual structure** that may exist in other people and maybe that's the clue, that there's a kind of **communal, if you like, mental fashion that emerges** to say, yes we understand this protein structure.
>
> Although no one there could reproduce, you know, the structure of haemoglobin, for example, and in fact no one would want to unless they were working on it. So I think that this will... this will emerge in the same way. The integrative work will be done in great detail — has to be done in great detail — on very circumscribed problems. And then once those are solved, then this will be the style with which you solve such problems and this will now become to be accepted as the solution and **people will just wonder why they ever asked such questions 50 years ago**.

## 210. Scientific progress: The heroic and classical periods

> The question is whether in the '60s we were right in thinking that all the problems of molecular biology had been... had been solved in outline. They were solved in outline because that is essentially what we... we saw the solution on, and we thought then the rest is... the rest is just, you know, routine work. Now, one of the remarkable things about science is that **routine work itself generates its important problems which you don't see**, and of course as you stand on the brink or on the edge... or on the transition point as science goes from the heroic... its **heroic period into its classical period** as Gunther Stent used to say, which of course by about 1961 that is exactly where molecular biology stood; there were no longer great heroes that would do all of this work, that were evangelists in some way that was bringing, that were bringing new message to... to everybody, because now the church was admitting everybody and everybody was becoming converted.
>
> So it's not... it's not useful to be, if you like... I mean, **being an early Christian must have been exciting, but to be one later is boring, because everybody's converted**. The only thing of being an old Jesuit in the church is you know what's wrong with the church basically, which the new converts don't. It's important to keep quiet about this in the early stages of building up the church. So I think the... and I think we were quite right, if arrogant, to say that for us that wasn't the sort of thing we wanted to do.
>
> Now of course in biology, **problems have a remarkable way of not being solved, of never being solved**. Take DNA replication. It has been thought to have been solved, I think, at least 10 times in the past, it's thought to be solved today. But I guarantee you people will be working on DNA replication for the next 20 years, for the simple reason that at each level is solved you, first want to know whether... what are the components that do it, then you see that it's not enough just to stick bases in and propagate the chain, you've got to have an editing step so there's going to be some more stuff that comes into that. And so I think these things accrete problems. It may well be that that will be the interest of an extremely small group that will continue with this and will become refined specialists and this just may be a niche of molecular biology which will have been exploited by one particular set of molecular biologists.
>
> I think it's important that that should go on, but people feel it can't... it's no longer a mystery. And because it's no longer a mystery people feel it can be solved by normal science. And **it's very important, I think, to grasp what can or can't be solved by normal science**, you can just go back to it there.

---

## 211. The effect of competition in science

> I'm not... the question is about competition. Well, the... well, there's one thing that I think is very important to say, is **if you're always doing new things there's always very little competition**. And it could be argued that in my career I've got out when the competition got hot, if you like. Or maybe I got out when the science got cool, that's another way of putting it.
>
> No, I don't think you can be affected by competition, although I think a lot of people are. And I think I've always had a consciousness of saying that if our lab starts to be driven, as many labs are, by the forces of competition, then we're in for a bad time for the simple reason that a whole lot of very different things will operate in what I think is... is... and ruin what I think is... is our work and which... which has this great meaning for us.
>
> And so I've always liked to feel — and even up to now in the work I'm doing now — I've always liked to feel, well **my people should feel that they're out there alone** and they can actually give the problem their big attention and not sit and worry that there are 2500 people sitting in Paducah Tech and are going to, you know, scoop them. And I have to say that **that's the great morale builder in a lab**, and that's what I think you want your young people to feel, because the rest of their lives is going to be spent in... in dealing with that, and in... in dealing with these social forces.
>
> So competition isn't... isn't a meaning... isn't meaning, and I know that when other people start to work with this it's okay, because I think we encourage them because all they do is help to build up our reputation. That's what I think is... you know that I'm a great follower of... and a great admirer of **Talleyrand**. Talleyrand was a remarkable person, a survivor of everything. He was of course Napoleon's foreign minister, but he persisted right throughout the most incredible changes of regime in France and survived everything to come out at the other end.
>
> But he had one remark which I have always thought is important, and it is, '**never do for yourself that which you can get other people to do for you**'. So we don't want to eat the world, but if we can get other people to help digest it, that becomes a very important part of science.

## 212. Fraud and embezzlement in science

> I remember at a meeting someone once stood up and said, 'Let's get crime off the streets and back into the labs where it belongs', you see. No, I think... I think fraud is a product of two things, actually. It's first... it's a product of the work structure, because we now have a managerial structure in many labs where there are generals and captains and corporals, there's a whole hierarchy of people that work, and in general the person, the head of a lab, has no direct connection with a bench. And someone working remotely there, there's no absolute direct connection with the benchwork.
>
> Now, that is bad. Because somebody may make an honest mistake, in fact I know things like this have happened, and come and say, I've got this, I've found this. Now the corrector supervisor sends him back again to go and repeat it or preferably do it in another way to support it. But sometimes it happens that this strikes home at the... in... in the man's mind that this is a novel and very extreme finding. And then he says, but that means, that means such and such and such and such. And now if you go and do the following experiment and you get this answer, right, then we... this'll happen. And indeed the person goes and does the experiment, and he doesn't get quite the answer, may need a little bit of massaging, but once you're on this, then **it's not fraud, this is what I call embezzlement**.
>
> Because **everybody believes that effectively they'll be able to put... one day it'll come right and everything will be put back and no one will know**. You see, so that's the embezzler who takes £10 out of the cash till every Friday night and lays it on the horses. What he thinks is, one day the horse will win and he'll put all the money back and no one will know. So I think a lot of that goes on, and I think that once... if you're doing experiments yourself, and you learn what all the snags are and you know that if you're working as part of a group so that you do part of the experiment yourself, then I think that it's very hard to... to get this kind of co-operative crime.
>
> I think the other things that are now being driven, I... I mean, are the material aspects of science, which is just actually getting enough money for the lab, I think quite a lot of activities there can lead to, if not fraud, certainly exaggeration, if we can put it this way. I think there's a lot of concealment. I think a lot of work is kept secret. That is, there's no free exchange in the sense that people don't tell you what they're doing if they think in fact you'll... you'll get there first. So the competition I think does... does make for kind of... a kind of... now that it's competition not at the individual level in this, but it's at the corporate level, makes then for a kind of struggle that is... that I think has its bad effects.

## 213. The rewards of being a scientist

> It also turns out that I think now there are other views about science which I think are wrong. I mean... people... if you ask young people today what it is... what it is... what are the rewards of being a scientist. Well, you know, you could get many people today think the rewards are to win a lot of prizes and get a lot of money, perhaps have a piece of a company, and... and get promotion and have grants and have a big group and have all the material things. But nobody thinks... and have publications and have them all in the proper journals and people will fight and scream in order to get their publication into journals, that you know, have somehow got into the... fashionable accolade, you see.
>
> But I think that if you were to say, well, **isn't the great thing about science that you can actually solve a problem? You can actually take something which is confused, a mess, and not only find a solution but prove it's the right one.** Now, I mean, that to me is really what I think drives us, I mean, should drive us.
>
> And if there's other things, then I think it ought to be dismissed, you know, and maybe we ought to just put, you know, commercial in front of all the other things; The Journal of Commercial Molecular Biology, or the... The Journal of Commercial Neurobiology, and let people publish there. So I think that... and of course since these institutions are teaching young people... by virtue of the fact that they are working in them, that they are being socially assimilated into them, **that's exactly what I think is the bad face of biology**.

## 214. Falling in love with a mistake

> You know, the… the thing is the other… the other difficulty in science and in doing science is **someone who gets hold of an idea which he then falls in love with**, right, and he can't let it go. Usually because this is so… it is so far out that he's certain no one else has thought of it and he really wants to… to bring this new torch of knowledge to mankind. And of course achieve fame and wealth at the same time. And there are many people that do this, often again starting from a mistake. Starting from something that is a phenomenon, but a phenomenon of that particular instance.
>
> I mean, I'm not saying these people invent observations, they do make the observations but **they are due to dirty tubes or somebody running their fingers across a petri dish or just leaving the window open** when the most surprising things will grow on your… on your petri dish. But they start from a fluctuation of the world — they're generated by Murphy's Law basically — and you come to believe that this is the ultimate solution and you do experiments which although would… at one point should lead you to question the nature of the observation, nevertheless drive you.
>
> And in fact one of the famous things that happened was in a subject that I gave the name — created a new subject for — called **hydro-immunology**. Now, this was a man called Benveniste who actually believed that he had some immune phenomena, some antibody… antigen phenomena, but in fact he had diluted this below, as it was said, **Avogadro's number**, so that the only possibility for making the… for making the observations he had done was that the antibody molecules had left their memory in the structure of the water. They had somehow recorded that they had been there, and the water then retained that memory and did the answer.
>
> Now of course that's a great theory. The other possibility to explain these experiments is that the measurements were wrong. Which they almost certainly were, because this is ludicrous. And so when I was asked about this and I had been told that he had diluted it below the value of Avogadro's number, I said **had he tried avocado's number**. And they said, 'What is avocado's number?'. I said, 'It's the number of molecules in a guacamole.' And I actually managed to get this published in *Science*, without referees.

## 215. Molecular genetics and gene cloning

> Well, the early molecular biology, the early molecular genetics, was really the science for a young man, because... and I really enjoyed it. And *C. elegans* (*Caenorhabditis elegans*) was... was a science that fitted by mature middle years, because it had a huge strategic component. That is, it wasn't something that you could go into the lab and do an experiment and get the answer the next day, but really needed the development of a... a lot of... techniques and a whole range of what I would call normal science. I mean, bringing the science of observation back to biology and getting the system into a form where in fact it could reap the benefits of the gene cloning that had been discovered about half way through its... its course. And so for twenty years, until the '80s, that is what I worked in, and I had spent...
>
> Well, I think the... in... during the course of the work on *C. elegans*, we had tackled the molecular questions. Starting at the begin... at the beginning of the '70s. And of course the thing that came along and made it the subject was of course gene cloning. And that is what we turned our attention to, and that of course has been the answer to all of developmental biology, that you find out how the gene works by cloning it and looking up its sequence in a database and seeing if anybody's got anything like this before. And then you can take comfort in each other's ignorance, if you like.
>
> However, once that had gone forward and once it became clear that other people could do this probably better than I could, that is, I felt very much that my role in this had... had been completed. And therefore it could be safely left in the hands of the children, so to speak, and I could go off and do other things. And the... I was very heavily involved in being the director of the lab and spending my time doing the accounts and trying to sort out budgets — really a total waste of time in my opinion — and I think it was the biggest mistake I ever made.
>
> However, what I came to realise now is that we had a new way of doing genetics. And that therefore instead of... of denying it, as many people thought... wanted to do, this was just going to be a whole new science, and if it was going to be a whole new science I want to be in it at the beginning. Now one of these was... there was this new way of doing genetics. The idea which was simply stated at the time when all of this came, is, let's go and get the whole sequence of a genome. Molecular genetics, if you like, classical molecular genetics was an extremely difficult way of reading the sequence of DNA. Now that we could do it directly, let's go and do it. And in principle we just have access to the total DNA. And that is what cloning DNA and sequencing it could give you.
>
> Therefore the classic approach to genetics could now take on a different... a different guise and what I thought immediately was it needs to be conducted with the same logic. And if you ask what does a geneticist want to know? He wants to know what are the genes? What do they do? How many do we have? How do they map onto phenotypic function? And how does he do this? Well, in classical genetics he collects mutants, because it is a paradigm of... it is the case of classical genetics that **you cannot assert the existence of a wild-type gene, that is a gene performing a normal function, until you have a mutation**, a deviant of it. Once you have the deviant, that proves there must be something. In other words, you cannot say there is a gene for... that makes plants tall until you find dwarf mutants, that is, until you find something that suffers from lack of tallness. And indeed that is the whole of genetics, that is, you must find something that suffers from the lack of the function you are doing. **You are doing surgery at the genetic level.**

---

## 216. Inside-out genetics gives faster results

> And so our job then... and every classical genetical thing, whether it was in phage or bacteria or *C. elegans* (*Caenorhabditis elegans*), and that is the way I began... began with **a mutant hunt**. You hunt for mutants and then you classify them. The way you classify mutations is you put them into the same organism and you see whether they complement each other. If they fail to complement you can say those mutations are in the same gene. If they complement, you know you've got different genes.
>
> And so you can conduct this exercise and come out and just say well, for movement I think we've got to have at least 10 genes that specify movement because I have 10 genes of paralysed mutants that show lack of movement. And these genes then, it's now up to you to show how they work. That of course was the difficulty with developmental biology... is one didn't know how to get into the system until we could clone the genes. Right.
>
> Now, what we could now do was effectively clone genes, sequence them, therefore we... we didn't have to do the mutant hunt. We could actually find the wild-type genes, they were there. And then we could ask — it's been called reverse genetics, but it's wrong — then we could ask what happens if I make a defect in this gene? Right, now. And then I'll see what the effect is on the organism. **Basically what it is, it's not reverse genetics but it's inside-out**, because the whole history of biology we pursue functions from the outside, from the phenotype, from say, finding people that suffer, that have... that are bad at high altitude, to discover by going through that they have abnormal red blood cells, to show they have a protein that has an abnormal way of aggregating, to finally showing that there's the protein with one amino acid change, and that's the sickle cell mutation. And that took... decades to do.
>
> Now we can start at the other end, which is to find the wild-type gene, since we know the genetic codes we can just write down the protein. And since, as information collects about proteins and what they do, we may be able to... to get much faster to map this in terms of phenotypic function, right. So here's the new approach to genetics. **What does it do? It liberates us from the life-cycles of organisms.** We had been bound to always do crosses, always our experiments depended on taking genotypes apart, seeing what happens and putting them together and seeing what happens. One generation at all times. And of course when we got experimental organisms, they had to have easy life-cycles, they had to have rapid ones so we could do a lot of experiments... didn't have to wait a year or two years for the answer. In that case we might well have forgotten what the question was by the time we got the answer.
>
> And I can remember giving my first lecture on this, in the... in about 1986, '87, in which I said, I've come to... you know, **we have now been liberated from the tyranny of the life-cycles of organisms, from their modes of reproduction. We can do genetics now on everything, anything. Giant redwoods, grapes, and most important, human beings.**

## 217. The daring act of sequencing the human genome

> Now of course there were lots of organisms that it would be interesting to know about, but which they were intractable or in some cases illegal to do genetic experiments. And of course that's why the genetics of man had gone so slowly, because we could only rely on certain markers and so on. But being able to approach that from the DNA just seemed to me to unify the whole of biology at one blow.
>
> And I think that when Wally Gilbert, or... it was Sinsheimer first suggested we should just sequence the whole of the human genome, just like... genomes of whole organisms have been sequenced, but they were bacteriophages, they were 50,000 base pairs. And of course to jump from 50,000, from 10⁴, to three billion, that is 3 × 10⁹, that's a **10⁵ jump**. **That's, that was some act, I wouldn't call it of imagination, it's certainly a daring act.** And of course a lot of people got together to say, yes, this is something that we would want to do.

---

## 218. Sequencing the human genome in a bingo hall

> Now, at that time I'd actually gone back to work with bacteria, to see if I could map a whole bacterium with the new techniques. That is, to get overlapping clones of cosmids and John Sulston joined me and we worked at that point — he'd also got a bit fed up with the nematode at that point — and we worked then developing techniques for an organism called *Rhodopseudomonas blastica*. It was just some small bacterium. And having developed various fingerprinting techniques so that we could do this, John then thought that what he would do is just take this straight off into *C. elegans* (*Caenorhabditis elegans*), which is what he did. And we continued a little with technology for bacteria and with... we worked with *Rhizobium* and I have to say I'm still interested in that and I'm still doing experiments to find good ways of getting maps of bacteria very quickly... ordered DNA clones.
>
> However, when all of this got moving at the more public level, and it had all started when Sinsheimer called a meeting of people to which I didn't go, because I couldn't go, this was in 1986. And John Sulston and Bart Barrell who was a sequencer and who had done the whole of EBV — Epstein-Barr Virus — which was the largest genome done at that time, they went. And the idea was, which Wally Gilbert appeared as the... the leading inspirer, the chief optimist, if you like... was that we should... the Holy Grail was to just sequence the whole of the human genome.
>
> Now, I think that that was... I mean, there was no technology and there still is today no technology that would allow us to do this in some reasonable time. And I got very heavily involved into the... the human genome programs, I got onto the American committee on this to decide where it is, and that history has been written over and over again. But the important thing to realise is that there was first of all gigantic antagonism of... of the scientists to this project. The... there's antagonism in that the way it was pictured was there'd be a factory somewhere that would generate sequences, right. And such factories are not... they are viable, but not in the context of science. That is, I... I still have to convince scientists that there are people in the world who would do this work, it's a job. They wouldn't be interested in the result. Because what they'd be interested in is the money, so that on Friday afternoon they can take that money and then go and pursue their interests, like have boats or gardens or so on. Scientists don't imagine that there are people like this. They think everybody is a student with a kind of right... inalienable right to be a genius, and that this would actually clamp him, and it's just not true, there are lots of people happy at their work.
>
> In fact, I thought we could actually do this by having something that was like **a bingo hall**. That is we could have these machines and we could put up the sequence of the day, people would actually pay to come and operate these machines and we'd have a prize. So it would cost you £10 to operate the machine, but if you happened to get the sequence of the day there'd be a prize of a £1000. And I think we'd be deluged with people wanting to come and play the machines, and we could put these up in shopping malls and supermarkets, we'd just get the sequence done very easily. And indeed, you know, although there are three billion base pairs, you realise in principle it could be done in an afternoon, let us say, by the population of China. Of course there's a bit of a problem organising the population to do it, but each would only have to do three of them, you see, of course.
>
> But so, I thought we needed... that showed very clearly that the perception of people as to what was understood by scientific work was... did seem to me to be very different. And everybody complained that this is going to be... bring in big science. You know, and everybody would be enslaved in some way. And of course... and... and then of course the real motives occurred, it would divert money from them. So the real issue about whether this could be funded or not — the project, the human genome project — is that it had to satisfy some kind of threshold of new money, so that it wouldn't be taking it away from the people, otherwise there would be screams and shouts, and that's really what all the politics was about. Where can you get new money?

## 219. Human Genome project generates new funds for science

> Now, I had by this time, by 1986, decided… had left the MRC [Medical Research Council], the... the Laboratory of Molecular Biology although I was still physically housed in it and I had a unit of my own, which I decided I would do the human genome in the UK, for the simple reason that I'd just been given a Jeantet Award which had a research fund of about £300,000 which I could use any way I liked. And so I had this — I've still got some of this money left actually — and so I started to hire people and we began to pursue our approach to it.
>
> And our approach was not to attempt to sequence the human genome, but to do it in the old way of looking for the genes. Now, the best way to look at genes was of, course, to look at their copies, cDNA. And the idea was, well, let's go and start to characterise cDNAs and sequence them, because each of those is a gene, and then what we should do is to put them on the map.
>
> Now, mapping became the dominant thing and mapping was wrong. Let me just… the reason it was wrong, from the point of view of a pure geneticist like myself, the map is — just happens to be one way to index the mutants — **the map is only required if you wish to operate on that organism in the real world**, if you want to understand human genetic disease or you want to breed better plants, you need genetic maps. But **if you want to understand human biology you need genes**. And we could accomplish both by finding genes and putting them on a map. It seemed to me to be such a straightforward thing, to construct what I said right at the beginning was: let's construct **a gene map**, because that's what geneticists do.
>
> No, we had to have enormous discussions as to whether this was going to be a physical map or a genetic map or… or this kind of map, or… or the other. There's only one map that you need, which is where… how… **give us the genes and tell us where they are. That was the task**.
>
> Now it took a… I did start this, but without very much funding and spent a lot of time trying to negotiate a special programme in this country, which I managed to do. And in fact did something which I think is totally remarkable for the '80s, which was actually to **generate some new money for medical research**. Because right throughout this period the government had been whittling away at the funds for research, and we actually created new money.
>
> And the thing that I'd like to say is the greatest benefit that ever brought is that if you simply today go to some laboratories you will see the number of young people, students and post-docs that this brought into the field. **The human genome research, rather than being a kind of big science factory, boring, has turned out to have attracted the most interesting and I think the brightest of the scientists are coming to this**, because I think they recognise that this is fundamental biology of the highest form and I think genome research is… is what it's going to do, is going to go that way.

## 220. Differences between human and fish DNA

> Now, the tale of what happened with the cDNA program and what happened in America, that's been written about. I think the Americans did create it, did turn it into a… did make it banal — that's the only word that I could use — by commercialising it, but the project still remains. But what I thought I would do is go and do something different.
>
> And so I had come to the conclusion a long time ago that the human genome was full of junk. And I propagated this widely, making very carefully the distinction between the two kinds of rubbish, namely, **junk which is rubbish that is kept, and garbage that is rubbish that is thrown out**. It turns out that most languages use two distinctive words to… to specify this kind of rubbish. In Japanese it's *Gomi*, which is dust, rubbish you throw out, and *Garacuta* which is junk that you keep. And… and of course you… **if there is rubbish in your genome, it must be junk because if it were garbage it wouldn't be there**.
>
> So by trying to press this and by trying to persuade people that this problem has to be done in stages, because I would be asked questions at lectures, how do you know there isn't any… there's nothing important in the junk? And aren't you worried? And I would say, no, I'm not worried at all, because **I believe in leaving problems to the next generation**. So you may be worried, but not me. I'm not worried at all.
>
> So I think by trying to get a perspective of what we should do first and not worry about what we were going to do at the end of the day, that is… that is… and I therefore felt that it was… I must try and do something different. So I asked the question, which is a question I've always asked myself: **is there an animal somewhere, that may not have acquired all this junk?** You know, a vertebrate. Not a pervertebrate, but a vertebrate that hasn't acquired this junk. And of course, easy to ask the question if you know the answer. And of course it's easy to ask the question if you know the answer.
>
> And I knew the answer, because at Woods Hole in the late '60s I had taught courses which was essentially on the C paradox, it worried me... worried me that there seemed to be organisms that had too much DNA. And as part of this I did a… I rotted my mind by reading in the fantastic library of the Woods Hole… the Woods Hole Ocean… the Woods Hole Marine Bio Lab. And I'd… and I knew of the journal because I'd been a reader of it for many years. It's a journal which I say is not a nudist magazine, it's called *The American Naturalist*, and it's a… and in this there were these… there were these papers by Heingardner. Heingardner had measured the DNA content of many species of fish.
>
> And this paper, published in 1968, it's 25 years ago, I knew — I had a copy of it, right — and I knew there were fish. Now, not only did I know that these were fish, but in fact, that fact had been widely… it was published, it's published in a calendar that had been given out by a company selling instruments. It's in many textbooks.
>
> *[Q] Sydney, I'm terribly sorry, you haven't told us what is the material.*
>
> The fish is that — what they had shown is that amongst all of these fish, there were **fish which had DNA contents about a 10th of that of man**, it's an 8th of that of man, eight times smaller genomes. Now, at the time, if you asked anybody, what do you think about this fish with eight times less DNA than man, the answer was, that's clearly all the fish deserve. And I reckon they are, you know… I reckon I'm eight times more complicated than this fish. So we had no idea of what all this DNA content meant then, we were only at the beginnings of repetitive DNA and so on.
>
> And a second paper was published in 1983 which was a cot curve on a similar group, members of fish, that was published there — I knew about that — and that showed also that the cot curves are remarkably like that that John Sulston and I did with *C. elegans* [*Caenorhabditis elegans*] which has very little repetitive DNA — 90% unique. So I thought, **it's possible to do — this fish may be the right thing to do**.

## 221. Fugu: the puffer fish genome

> Now, I tried to get these fish for quite some time. They are **puffer fish**. And I then decided that such is the… such is the unreliability of natural sources that we could start to work on this and find that some pollution or some fire or… or something has… has got rid of them in the world, they've become extinct. Actually today we now say that we don't care if they become extinct as long as we've got enough DNA to keep us going, or we've cloned it all.
>
> So, I then decided that I would go and get the one specimen of this fish which is actually fished and cultivated for food, in Japan. And it is the **fugu — the Japanese puffer fish**. Now, when I went to Japan and — to try to organise this — and I managed to organise this and people said, why are you interested in this? I said, I'll give you a little talk on junk. Nobody believed this, they said it's… the measurements must be wrong. It can't be that you have something with so little DNA, the measurements must be wrong.
>
> Well, to cut the long story short, we got this, I managed to find a group of young people to work with me, and we were able to devise a fairly reasonable way, because of course what you want to try and prove is that **this fish has the same number of genes as we do**, because if it only has 1/8 the number of genes it isn't interesting. And that we were able to do by what I think's a very pretty experiment. What we did is we just did — it's a new technique called **statistical genomics** — we just took 600 pieces of DNA randomly and sequenced them, and asked, how many genes can we find? That is genes that have already been found in other vertebrates and in particular in the mammals, that occupy most of this. And having found the probability of finding these genes we could then go and ask — because we didn't have to do the experiment — because we could then calculate what is the abundance of these genes in the genome. And what we found is it was eight times more enriched in the fugu, therefore, what we could prove is that **we had the same number of genes, more or less**, and everything we've done has borne that out.
>
> So I think I like to call the fugu **the discount genome**, because you get 90% discount on sequencing. And since I think I've enhanced the job tenfold, then I've fulfilled the great technical requirement which everybody said we should have, a tenfold step in technology every five years, and so I've done that in a few months **just by choosing the right organism**.
>
> Now, I think that this will now become a world-wide use. We have now a lot of people coming to our lab to… to find pieces of DNA that correspond to this, and I'm encouraging as many people to work on this, because…
>
> *[Q] Could you explain why it's so helpful?*
>
> Well, if you… to explain why it's so helpful is the following. Let us just assume that certain groups of genes have stayed together throughout this whole period of about a half a billion years of evolution. Now, many people can map a human gene, let's say a gene for breast cancer, but they can only find it into a piece of DNA, somewhere in a piece of DNA that's a million base pairs. Right. Now, to sequence through the million base pairs and find the gene is enormously tedious and time consuming. Right? And what we are saying is, well, you'll only have to do a 100,000, a 125,000, because what you do is you start with something on this, go and get the piece of the fugu genome and then move along.
>
> And let me just say that whereas on the average **a gene in man is 50,000 bases, the gene in fugu is 6,000 bases**, and in fact we have now got pieces of DNA which is 40,000 base — it's called a cosmid — and on this we have as many as eight genes. Seven to eight genes is the popular thing. Therefore, what we find is that all the intervening sequences are there, they're in the same place so these are the same genes, but they are small, very tiny, and also the genes are close together. They're not separated by large amounts of junk DNA.

---

## 222. Benefitting from less junk in Fugu DNA

> Well, the fish… fish gene is about 1/8 the size of the human gene. We have sequenced many of these and compared them with the human gene, and in all cases find the same number of introns, but **the introns are tiny in the fish**, and whereas they can be enormous in… in the human or mammalian gene. And one of the things that of course would be important is exactly how — what's called in the trade synteny, but synteny is on a much larger scale, that means on the same chromosome, on the same chunk of DNA; I like to call this contiguity, because it's going to be on a small scale — to what extent this has been conserved. And we have growing evidence that this is conserved over reasonable distances.
>
> A rough calculation showed us that it might be conserved over about **a million base pairs of human DNA**, and… which would be equivalent to a **100,000 base pairs of fugu DNA**, and it may be of that order or even better. So this enables you to go and find human genes simply by using the fish, and it also enables you to actually go and characterise human genes, which are enormous.
>
> For example, the gene that's affected in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, dystrophin, is **2.8 mega bases, that is 2… nearly 3 million base pairs**. Whereas the parts… the part that we have already sequenced has been **reduced by a factor of 20 in size**, and so that if the whole thing were to follow the rest of it — which we're still doing — were to follow this, then the fish gene would be of the order of about 150,000 base pairs, which means we could characterise it.
>
> Which means that **we could characterise genes very quickly**. Now, I think a large number of people will come to use this, and in fact I do not want to set up a big institute to do this, but in fact I think it should be dispersed. I think the technology does not exist yet to… to tackle sequences as large as 400… genomes as large as 400 million base pairs, and until that develops we want a lot of people to come and get the benefit from this. It will also help us — following the Talleyrand principle which is: never do for yourself that which you can get other people to do for you — it will also help us to get a lot more information on this. And you might want to be interested in what is the information we are looking for.

---

## 223. From fish to man in DNA

> Now, I think that what… what we will find immediately is how these pieces of DNA in this fish correspond to pieces in the human genome. So that we will see how perhaps some primordial vertebrate genome got fragmented in different ways as we pass from, let us say, the fish to man.
>
> Now, I'm going to make a… a little elision at this point, which is to assume that the — which I think I have the right to assume — that **the fish is much closer to the original than we humans are**. And that is, if we were to compare, without looking at any other evidence, the fish genome and the human genome, we could define what was the common… what was common to those genomes, and hence what presumably the parent of both did, but we wouldn't be able to say whether it was more like a fish or like a man. That is, both have travelled through the same length of time, but clearly we… we want to know who has travelled through more complexity space. And of course we know this, because we find fossils of fish going back half a billion years and don't find human fossils. So we know that this fish looks more like this.
>
> And hence although it has… the genome has been exposed in time to the same forces that the human genome, that is to the same forces of mutation and nucleotide substitution and so on, we can say that if we take genes from the fish and compare them with the human, in one sense **we are looking across a half a billion years of the past**. If you like, the fish has preserved in a fossil form the genome of a fossil fish in its present form. It's fossilised the genomes there, right, with what it is. But that tells us also that we can now find out what happened in evolution. Or at least we can make a good approximation to it.
>
> Now, let… to try to explain this, let us suppose I were to start a new genetic program and I wrote a grant saying I am now really interested in… in really interesting mutations; so I want to get a fish, I want to put it in the lab, and I want to make mutants and **I want to turn it into a man**. Because that's the only really interesting thing, nobody else is interested in anything else, because that's a… that's all we have to explain, is how fish became men in the course of time. And, of course, you know… you know you're a little fish at some point of your own development, you've got little gills and so on. So we could at least have tried to explain how you went on from being a little fish to being a little man.

---

## 224. Putting fish genes into humans and mice

> And of course, if I did this no one would give me an absolute penny. But you see, it's already being done for us. Those experiments have been done, we've got the mutants, we've got the human mutants and we still have some representative of the original stock, the fish. Therefore, why don't we just do genetics on these? So why don't I just do the following, I'll take a gene out of the fish and put it into a man. Well, can't do that, so I'll do it in a mouse, which is the experimental animal.
>
> And now I'll ask for that gene, do you work in the mouse? Now, the mouse, of course, could be argued from point of view of physiology and anatomy to have a fishy part and to have something that got added on. There still is a fishy part to the mouse. The immunology will still be fishy; no, but the lungs certainly won't be, because they just aren't present in this. So if I find this gene, let us say, that expresses in the lungs of a human and I find the same gene in a fish, I can ask whether that fish gene will express in the lungs. Now, if it doesn't — so this only will express in the fishy part of the mouse — I have to say that that gene just retains that information, all right, and therefore I should look at the mouse gene there to see what has happened here. Has other things been added on? Has it moved to another place, perhaps, where it has a different regulation? That's probably what would have happened.
>
> Then in the other case, **if the fishy gene expresses all over the mouse**, that is you couldn't tell the difference between the two mice, one with a mouse gene and one with a fish gene, **then I have the right to say that evolution went at a higher level** in the program and this remained the same. So what we can find throughout these is those invariant parts of the genome that just stayed the same and which we expect will be… will be invariant in the sense that as we all know, in development, when you want a new muscle you don't start from the beginning again and reinvent all the proteins, you just have a way of saying: do what you know, but do it here and not there.
>
> So I think that this is the way really to do the genetics of complex regulation. And I think the present idea of doing it by cutting out a piece and seeing what happens, this is… this is going to be just too tedious and too boring to do.

---

## 225. The genetics of evolution

> So I called this **genetics by composition rather than genetics by decomposition**. And I think that this is going to be the way in which we will tackle all the complex problems, and what is beautiful is they will be referred to evolution. We will not only provide evolutionary explanations of what there is now, but **we'll explain the evolution of what there is now**. That is, those are two different things, we'll be able to say, this is what happened in this.
>
> And since the whole of living matter is accessible to this — the whole of living matter is just DNA, I mean, is accessible to this — we can, I think, ask questions now in a deeply analytical way about problems that you couldn't even begin to frame, by just using this technology. And in essence **a transgenic animal or a transgenic cell is just a cross of a genome with a gene**. So we look at that recombinant and ask whether it's the same.
>
> I just want to emphasise one point, because the way we do this is the following, to be rigorous. We simply ask this: if we make two animals, one… they're absolutely identical. One has this section of DNA from the mouse, the other has the analogous section from the fish. Then I'll argue, **if you cannot tell the difference between them, they have the same value**. Therefore you're entitled to say that because they have the same value, it is that they have the same… anything that's common in their sequence is therefore that which works.
>
> And you want to go far away, like fish and mouse, because **you want time to have corroded everything that is non-essential**. If you do things like mice to man, there hasn't been enough time. We contain mousy features simply because we came from something that also gave rise to mouse. But fish is so far away that effectively we've put enough noise into the rubbish to be able to say, this is the rubbish, this is junk.
>
> So that I think is a rigorous experimental approach to this and that's why I think **we will be actually doing the genetics of evolution** in the next few years. I think that this will be the way to do it.

## 226. My strengths and weaknesses

> This is the time when one has to have true confessions.
>
> I think **my skills are in getting things started**... it's the opening game.
>
> I'm not very good at... the other thing I'm rather good at is talking.
>
> I think **keeping up the conversation is one of the important roles one can have in science**.
>
> I think I'm rather good also at **brainwashing**, which is to persuade people to do things that their upbringing tells them they ought not to be doing.
>
> I'm not a very good administrator, in fact, I'm rather hopeless.
>
> One of my weaknesses is... **I'm not as good as a mathematician as I really wanted to be**.
>
> **I'm very bad at writing, I really resent writing.**

---

## 227. Evaluation of my character

> Well, I mean, other people have told me what my weaknesses are, but I don't agree with them. Like, you know, I'm insulting, I'm arrogant and so on. I don't think I am, actually. **I think I'm pretty honest basically** and… and I think I know what I'm trying to do and I think that science is so important and what we're trying to do is so important within it, that I sometimes do express impatience with the sort of people that lie in the way.
>
> Well, I think one of my great advantages is **I have a good sense of humour, particularly about myself**. And that's one of the great things that, I think, one ought to have. I think once one has a complete… once… what one should always have is a complete sense of how ludicrous… not possibly how ludicrous you are, but **how ludicrous you can be**, and I think that's very important. **Pomposity is one of my great fears**. I think pompousness in an old man is terrible. Of course, pomposity in a young man is… is absolutely beyond the pale.
>
> After that I consider, you know, that I've been very lucky to have survived the… this whole path in science and have been able to indulge in what I wanted to do, but as I've always said, **if one can do what one is interested in and be of benefit to mankind, why not?**

---

## 228. Thoughts on creativity

> Well… well, you ask about insights into creativity. Now, this is a subject that preoccupies a lot of people because of course everybody would like to be creative and everybody wants to know where can they get it from. I mean, you know, if you could get a packet of creativity and buy it somewhere, that would be the ideal thing.
>
> I don't… I think one of the things about creativity is **not to be afraid of saying the wrong thing**. I think that's terribly important. Too many people are brought up, especially in our culture, that everything should be rational, should be worked out, and that daring ideas, you know, shouldn't be uttered simply because they are most likely to be wrong the first… the first time around. And I think the other answer to creativity is that, I mean… **daydreaming is terribly important, but the essence of science is to bring it… to realise it, to implement it**.
>
> And I think one of the things about creativity is to absolutely know where and how one could actually prove this. Now, I know there's a lot spoken about Popper's approach to this, in which one should actually work out ways of… of disproving one's theory. Of course Popper I don't think is too… too cognisant of the psychology of scientists. He may know something about the philosophy of science, but you find me a scientist who's actually going to sit down and work a way out of disproving his results. Because most of us, realising the pernicketiness of nature and the unreliability of nature, have to work hard to prove our results. Because the first time an experiment is done it's likely not to work. Not because the theory is wrong, but just because the whole entropic universe is reaching us instantly we start to dabble in it.
>
> So I think it takes quite a lot of… **part of creativity is actually something which is a bit irrational, which is a feel that this is the right thing.** And that one will go to some lengths, actually, to realise it.

---

## 229. Ways to approach science

> Now, I mean, I'm doing something now which is quite interesting because it's… it has involved **turning things upside down**. And I think turning things upside down is something that we are not encouraged to do by our culture. Our culture has now imposed upon us that we should start at point A and proceed by the… by logical steps to B, C and D. But, you know, it sometimes is useful to ask whether in fact the effect is actually the cause, if I can put it that way. And what would it be like if indeed what you think is the outcome is actually the cause of the predecessor, just putting it in a very general way. So I think **inversion is… is sometimes a very useful way of being able to see things from another point of view**.
>
> Of course, what people should realise is that this… it takes also some kind of iron censor within oneself, that is, **one should not fall in love with one's theories. They should be treated as mistresses to be discarded once the pleasure is over.** That is what I think is… is a very important thing, and it's one of the characteristics of science that you must be ruthless towards your loved ones. When they go ugly, kill them. Get rid of them. Too much of science is… is dominated by people who fall in… of course, it's a way of falling in love with yourself, basically, and are very reluctant to give it up. Even though everything is strained at… at the… the joint.
>
> I mean, I once invented a thing called **'Occam's broom'**, or 'Occam's brush', as we say, and that is **the hypothesis which has the fewest of things you sweep under the carpet to leave it consistent**. And I think that one cannot go on sweeping things up under the carpet, you know, once the carpet has got an altitude of about 10 feet.
>
> So I simply… I simply believe that it takes… it takes a kind of mixture of… I've always felt that **science makes completely contradictory demands on the people that work on it**. It asks you to be… to be highly imaginative, yet it asks you to put on blinkers and drive through brick walls if necessary to get to the answer. It asks you to be passionate about invention, but it also asks you to be ruthless and cut off your own hand if it comes to that. And I think there are very few people that can combine this kind of… these opposites into one person. And looking at my students I've often found that all the characteristics of the one half are in one student, and all the characteristics of the other half are in the other student. So there are brilliant people that can never accomplish anything. And there are people that have no ideas but do things. **And if only one could chimerise them — join them into one person — one would have a good scientist.** Perhaps that's why science has to operate as a group, as a social unit.
>
> So I think that… and I can only say that to me the way I do my thinking is to **bounce lots of balls in my head, bounce, bounce, bounce**. And if you go on bouncing you begin to notice that sometimes two are bouncing together. **Those I think are the connections we have to make**, and that means that you've just got to go on thinking about things, and if it were like this what would be the outcome, and that I think's a very important thing to do in biology.

## 230. The balance between ignorance and knowledge

> Well, you ask about the balance between ignorance and knowledge. Of course, I've said it's good to be ignorant and I've also said it's good to know, in fact, I do know a lot. I think **it is good to be ignorant about a new field and know a lot about the old ones, as you transit from the old to the new**. And maybe… so those things are not as contradictory as they may seem.
>
> Let me give you one example. I mean, two years ago I wrote a paper called *Encoded Combinatorial Chemistry*. This was a rather bizarre, and I think very important conceptually, and possibly a technological… technological invention, in which we apply genetic arguments and the… and actually give a mechanism of using it in… for inanimate material. And the question that is proposed there is how would you take just ordinary chemistry and be able to do natural selection on it? And of course you can't, if you say, natural selection depends on replication — I mean, glucose can't replicate itself. So that means that's out. So what you have to do is basically to have a lot of glucose and be able to extract more from it than you start with. And that's possible.
>
> Since the only thing you can replicate is DNA, then what you have to do is to have a gene for glucose. But of course we don't want to invent a gene that makes glucose, but now with technology we can actually synthesise a gene and we can say this gene stands for glucose. Right? So that means we simply have a table and we simply attach this gene to glucose, which is the way we put glucose into the same area, into the same physical environment as this gene — the way we link phenotype to genotype. But if you look at this... this is very… this is completely different to the standard genetic system, in which we actually define the genotype from the phenotype.
>
> Now, this means that with this genetic tag and with PCR [polymerase chain reaction] we can always amplify the tag. But if you think about it, the tag — because DNA is double-stranded — every time we amplify a tag we get both chains. Therefore one chain is always a specific way to enrich for glucose. Therefore formally in such systems you can realise Darwinian selection for systems that are purely chemical simply by reversing the information transfer, if you like, by the intervention of human discipline.
>
> Now, it's very lucky that I knew very little about chemistry, because when this proposition, which is theoretically correct, was shown to chemists it was turned down by people saying, you'll never be able to make these. That is, you know, you just argue out of ignorance, well, I'm sure there must be the various protecting groups that you can do. No, many people looked at this and said it's impossible to do. Now, I think they knew too much organic chemistry, and the fact that we persisted and do it depended on me **being completely, well, not completely ignorant, but ignorant enough about the field** to say, well, it is not beyond the wit of chemists to find this if they look hard enough. But of course, the original thinking there was nothing to do with organic chemistry, and it had to do with the… the logic of knowing a lot about genetics and knowing a lot about what the things really meant there.
>
> So that is what I think it's important, why I say it's important to be ignorant, because had I listened to the organic chemists that would never be a practical thing. So, since I've spent a lot of time in my life in going from one field to another I've always… always been in this **permanent transition between knowledge and ignorance**. So maybe I just find it a very natural way to proceed.

## 231. My greatest achievements

> Well, I think the… I mean, the thing that I think is the most… well, I've had many different kinds of achievement. I think the ***C. elegans* is a monumental achievement**. I think it generated, you know, a kind of industry of science.
>
> But if I think what is the intellectual achievement, then I think it would be in the classical genetics of *r*II, and the two things are **the triplet nature of the genetic code**, and of course the whole of decoding suppression triplets. So, I think that is what I would like myself to say that had some intellectual content and was in fact, if I were to… to use words like brilliant — was brilliant in that it shone in that sense.
>
> I think the messenger RNA experiments is something I will be remembered for, for the simple reason that, I think, historically it came at an important time and bridged something that at least in the minds of most people was proving a complete block to further advancement. Without that concept… and, of course, what drove in came from many sources, and my contribution was just one little thing on that, but in fact I think my great contribution to that was to find a way of doing a decisive experiment.
>
> **Being a rebel has always appealed to me**, largely because I'm convinced that the… that the standard parts of any activity are already petrified at the core.

## 232. My failures

> *[Q] What about failures?*
>
> Well, failures...
>
> *[Q] Maybe there hasn't been one, but…*
>
> Well, I haven't had a scientific failure in the sense that I've laboured for a long time and it hasn't come to, because **I've been pretty ruthless at cutting off things that haven't done**. I'd… I think the… and I think in terms of… of doing the wrong thing for a long time, where one just laboured under this, this is hard to say.
>
> I don't think that… so I have to say that what, given some other lack of something else, what would have been a failure? **I think the Nematode Programme wouldn't have been a failure, but it wouldn't have had the success it had were it not for the invention of cloning.** I think that this is really the most dramatic piece of technology that has really, you know, changed our science, and I think that that is a real… will be seen historically as a big inflection point. And I think the… that to… to realise this turned something that might have become just zoology into the centre of molecular biology, but I think that is what happened to all of developmental genetics. So… so I don't think it was a failure not to see. I think the people who would refuse to accept that as something would have failed.
>
> **I think I did fail in one respect, and that is something I tried to do administratively.** When I… one of the great things about the Cambridge laboratory was the continuous flow of young people through it. And part of our success is that we were world innovators, and so we attracted the most outstanding group of young people, largely from America in the '60s, who came to the lab and with whom I feel a tremendous rapport. Many of them are now important figures of American science and European science. And I hope that we had generated — Francis and I did this together — that we had generated **a unique atmosphere to do biology**. That is, you would work at the… at the edge of the subject, you could do it your own way, and you could… and you could actually make progress in that.
>
> And I realised that — and then during the '60s and more so in the '70s and of course excessively in the '80s, the whole of that kind of science began to solidify — that's the only thing that I can say — and the means of getting money to do science and the attitudes, **we've become much more bureaucratised**. And I think the Medical Research Council underwent those changes, when I compare what it took to get a building in 1960s on a programme, with what it takes now to get funding for a post-doc and how much paper you have to write, it's absolutely ridiculous.
>
> And what I tried to do when I became director of the lab… The lab was a federation of three labs — it was a four but I united my group with Francis', and they were Fred Sanger's group and the crystallography group and the group that Francis and I had. And my job was to make it a union. Not a federation. And **I took the view that the only way to survive is to get young people and let them do what they like**. Unfortunately many of my colleagues thought that we should get young people, but they should work for them, and I'm afraid that I did… I made many appointments during my time but I did not succeed in convincing the structure and so whereas I had hoped to leave an entire new generation of many outstanding young scientists, that did not happen.
>
> So I don't think I was a lousy director in that sense, but I think I failed in achieving something which I would have thought is the right thing, and it just hasn't been achieved and I think that'll be to the detriment. However, I did go off and start another lab where we have some young people and so, therefore, you know, we'll just continue business under another name.

## 233. The exciting future of biology

> Well, you asked to see how the subject will be in 30 years' time. I think that the two things that will happen is… the **three things that will happen** will be the following. I think **evolution will become an experimental subject** which will be wonderful. I think with that sort of knowledge we will even start to make new animals, perhaps… I once gave a lecture on how to make a centaur by means other than transplantation surgery — which is the way the Greeks made centaurs — and what you would have to know in terms of developmental biology to create a six-limbed vertebrate, because that's what centaurs are.
>
> But I think we will move on towards, I think, **synthetic biology**. I think also that in terms of… so I think evolution is going to be the subject over the next 25 years. I think there are going to be amazing discoveries that are going to tell us quite a lot about the past, and I think we're actually going to recapitulate the past. And that, I think, will be the most exciting thing, and I think it will bring a new kind of synthetic approach to the subject, which is now just being carved into smaller and smaller pieces.
>
> I think that in terms of the understanding of… I think the big subject that will develop, the subject that will have to be reinvented, is **physiology**. So that is, nobody knows how to connect up all these molecular events to the actual functioning of an organism, or an organ system, so I think physiology will have to be reinvented so that we can grasp how all this molecular stuff is embedded in the function of an organism.
>
> And, of course, **the physiology that'll be the most interesting will be the physiology of the brain**. There's a tremendous discussion now on neurobiology and its theory and what is consciousness and so on, and I think a lot of this discussion will just… all the… way people are talking about it will vanish, you see. I'm one of the people who believes **the brain is a gland which excretes thoughts** and, roughly speaking, we have to, you know, find out how this excretion is carried out and I think we'll… we'll get this and…
>
> So I think that's going to be a… but that's trite. But the subject I think that's going to be very interesting, which the new biology will open up, is in fact the **understanding of ourselves as organisms**. I think for the first time we can **attack the fundamental biology of man** and I see even now the beginnings of trying to understand our evolution and our history and our culture and in terms of our biology as one thing, so I think the great dream of the human sciences will be realised in the near future because we can just… and if it is correct that the genome still retains evidence of past history, we should be able to recreate history beyond the written word and integrate it with this, so I think there will be more of that science.

## 234. The profession of science will change

> And of course, I… I believe that… I think **the profession of science will change markedly over the next 25 years** because I don't think it can last as it… in its present structure. Now, the present structure wants… the present structure is assumed on infinite growth. In other words, every student expects to be a post-doc, every post-doc expects to be an assistant professor with five students. Every assistant professor expects to be an associate professor with eight post-docs and five students and so on and so forth and **that can't last** and I… and I think the industrial structure will have to change.
>
> And what I think will happen in the future is that, I think, **people will do research for only part of their lives** and I think research — with very few exceptions — is really the job for young people, largely because as I've said they contain the required ignorance that is necessary for this, and I think it would be perfectly reasonable for people to do research for 5 years or 8 years of their lives and then go on to do other things, like be doctors or be farmers or something else in society.
>
> But I think the profession of the professional scientist with a career structure will change, because I think it may well be that doing biology will become like the old days of doing natural history but with molecular tools, and I think we have to have some solution of that if we are to… if we are to simply maintain the advance, because all of history shows that notwithstanding the great growth and professionalisation of science **the number of important sciences has remained constant, roughly speaking, since the 17th century**.
>
> So, the point is… is that as long as those people gravitate to the subject that'll be fine. For the rest of it, as I've always said, we should always decide, I mean, **why is it necessary to solve all problems in this generation?** There are things we should leave to our successors and it seems to me there are lots of problems — I could write them all down — in which it wouldn't matter if they were solved 30 years in the future. I mean there… there are clearly problems that we need to solve now, but lots of them could wait and that's what I think we… we would do.
>
> And the last thing, I think, is that I think **DNA will come to occupy the centre of biology** as it has in the past. And I wanted very much to have… because I think man will destroy everything living on this planet, I would like to preserve everything in the form of DNA. And what I wanted was… and I created these words very carefully, because before the recession I thought I could interest the Japanese in funding this but I'm afraid this isn't the case now; which is to have **a DNA treasure house**. I like the word 'treasure house', not 'museum', and the idea would be this: is collect the DNA of every living species and just store it. I mean, ultimately we could certainly sequence it and find out what it is long after it's gone, so why trust to this terrible risk of... of survival of DNA in the form of a fossil when we could deliberately fossilise it, and then who knows, in 20 years' time, 50 years' time **we could have our own Jurassic Park**, except we wouldn't be as stupid as they were the way they do it and we could recreate these organisms.
>
> So I think that may well be the sort of thing, and organisms will be characterised on their DNA. I mean it's happening now in the sense that we've now come to realise that **more than 90% of the micro-organisms in nature can't be cultivated, but we could retrieve them by their DNA**. So there's a whole… whole areas of biology that are waiting to be done.

## 235. Personal interests outside of science

> Well, I'm not… I wouldn't consider myself to be a great follower of the arts, in the sense that I… I did paint when I was younger. My wife is the owner of several original Sydney Brenner paintings, but I… and I can appreciate them and so on. I do listen to music; as I grow older I like the ensembles to have less and less members. I had reached the stage a few years ago where I found that anything above a quintet was too noisy. I'm at the trio stage now.
>
> I do have interests in philosophy and reading and biography and history and autobiography. And the past does live on, does live in individuals and it's very interesting to be able to read about it.
>
> I have a great… one of my hobbies is to actually try and collect what scientists have written about their own lives. A lot of scientists have written their autobiographies. And some of them are very revealing. And the thing that I think is very good about them is that they **recreate** worlds that are no longer there.
>
> I think the first volume of Richard Goldschmidt's life is wonderful simply for the fact that it recreates what it was like to be a student in Germany in the 1890s. Max Born wrote about his own life for his family, essentially, and it describes what it was like in pre-war Germany, and of course what it was like to be a Jew in Germany at that time.
>
> And of course, these worlds are lost except through this and I suppose **as one gets older one wants to try and preserve something**.

## 236. Scientific heroes

> Well, I… you ask whether I have scientific heroes and the answer is the… there are many people that I admire, both that I've known and that I've… and that I've read about.
>
> **Von Neumann is a great scientific hero to me** because it seemed… he seemed to have something. And of course it may be envy rather than admiration, but it's good to envy someone like von Neumann.
>
> Of course, I've always admired **Francis Crick** who, I think, has the brain that effectively **always asked the right question**, even though he never got the right answer, but he asked the right questions.
>
> I always had a soft spot and did admire **Leó Szilárd**, simply again because he kind of was this representative of a world that I felt I had some kind of connection to. I mean, growing up in South Africa with some connection to Europe makes… gives it a kind of fantastic background that one wants to grasp because one feels sort of in one's genes, so to speak, one is connected there. And of course one isn't really but it's that feeling of continuity and that, you know, that one thing when I met Leó Szilárd I said, God, he looks like one of my uncles, you know, the rich one. And… but nevertheless, **it is the continuity to past worlds that I found fascinating**.
>
> What I liked about Leó Szilárd was his **complete obliviousness to the conventions and the criteria** of this and his complete focus on what came out of his head and that I found was… was admirable.

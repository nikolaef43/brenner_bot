Meta prompt:

"I want you to read and carefully study and ruminate on these transcripts of extended interviews with Sydney Brenner and I want you to find the sort of "inner threads" and general abstract patterns/symmetries about his whole manner and approach to scientific inquiry and why it was so fruitful and effective. How was he able to form such good hypotheses so quickly on such scant data/observations? How was he able to survey the infinite space of "possible experiments" to find the next few to do that would be the most discriminative and yield the most in terms of incremental insights or new hypotheses? How was he able to consistently see so much further ahead as to what were likely to be the most fruitful areas to look next where his unique analytical and theoretical gifts could yield the most outsized impact in the shortest amount of time? What about his approach made it less dependent on big expensive machinery and technology, and more reliant on clever thinking and logic/induction? How did he employ Bayesian probabilistic reasoning implicitly in how he chose experiments to do and how to interpret the results of those experiments?"

So it was that kind of background.","section":2,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0.059028133610095526,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0.059028133610095526,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,-0.1770844008302866,0,0,0.11805626722019105,0,0.11805626722019105,0,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0.1770844008302866,0,0.3541688016605732,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0.2361125344403821,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.059028133610095526,0,0.059028133610095526,0,0.059028133610095526,0,0,-0.2361125344403821,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0.059028133610095526,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0.059028133610095526,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0.11805626722019105,0,0,-0.2361125344403821,0,0,0,0,0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0.11805626722019105,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0.4722250688807642,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0,0.2951406680504776,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11805626722019105,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11805626722019105,-0.11805626722019105,0.059028133610095526,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11805626722019105,0,0.1770844008302866,0,0.1770844008302866,-0.059028133610095526,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.059028133610095526,0,0,0.059028133610095526,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-3-1","text":"> I think that to try and understand what the whole of this culture, or this immigrant culture in Johannesburg, was... it can be very easily illustrated by an original piece of sociological research that I conducted after I came to England. I was... met some people who said they'd met some nice South Africans who had come from Johannesburg and they were talking about mutual friends of them... of theirs, and the South African said, 'Oh, those Peruvians'. So they said, 'Well, we then went to the other people when we met them and said, \"We didn't know you came from Peru\", and they got very upset'. > > Now, I said to them, 'Don't worry, you know, this is a... this is a term of... of abuse and in fact it means... it's a kind of Jew who is stingy, mean, uneducated, uncultured'. And they said, 'But how... what on earth is the connection with Peru?' So I said, 'Well, look, I don't know, I've never thought about it until now, but I will do some research'. > > So I went and did research and the long story can be cut short. The following is the true origins of this word, because it was clear it was impossible for 90% of South African Jews to have come from Peru; that was inconceivable. I then discovered that when the immigrants came, there had been prior to this great movement at the turn of the century – the first 20 years – there had been a much earlier immigration of Jews from... largely from Germany, who of course were financiers and, incidentally, the same history is the same as the one in America. Namely the earlier immigrants, the Lehmans and so on, who'd come from Germany, were succeeded later by the East European ones. > > The people who had come from Eastern Europe decided to form an organisation which was called in Yiddish the **Polnischer und Russischer Yiddische Verein**, abbreviated to **PERUV** – Polnischer und Russischer Yiddische Verein. PERUV. And the people who attended this club came to be called *Peruvnics*, which fits, but later this had become anglicised, as indeed you know; Simon turned into Seymour, and, you know, all the names that come... and so they were called Peruvians. It was a much more gentile... hence the origin of the word Peruvian Jew. It only has... nothing to do with Peru but with origins in Eastern Europe and reflects exactly the age-old disdain that the German Jews had felt for the Eastern European immigrants – the Eastern European co-religionists. > > And that was that story, then, and... and of course it was amazing to me in later life to find that the same cultural thing had been gone through in exactly the same way in... in America. Later, when I got to know Ed Shils very well and went to visit with him in Chicago, exactly the same kind of history took place in Chicago between the earlier immigrants and the later people from Eastern Europe, who did that.","section":3,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.047053396691645995,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.015684465563881998,0.015684465563881998,-0.015684465563881998,0,0,0,-0.031368931127763997,0,-0.12547572451105599,0,0,0.10979125894717398,0,0.07842232781941,0,0,-0.07842232781941,0.031368931127763997,0,0,0,0.5803252258636339,0,0,-0.015684465563881998,0.015684465563881998,-0.047053396691645995,0,0,0.21958251789434796,0,0.31368931127764,0,0,-0.07842232781941,0,0,0.015684465563881998,0,0.06273786225552799,-0.031368931127763997,0,0,0,0,0.031368931127763997,0,0,0,0,-0.015684465563881998,0,-0.07842232781941,0,-0.015684465563881998,0.06273786225552799,0,0,-0.015684465563881998,0,-0.031368931127763997,0,-0.015684465563881998,0,-0.06273786225552799,0,-0.015684465563881998,0,-0.031368931127763997,0.06273786225552799,-0.015684465563881998,0,-0.015684465563881998,0.031368931127763997,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.015684465563881998,0,0,0,-0.015684465563881998,0,0,0,-0.047053396691645995,0.015684465563881998,-0.07842232781941,0.031368931127763997,-0.047053396691645995,0.015684465563881998,0,0.031368931127763997,-0.015684465563881998,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.015684465563881998,-0.015684465563881998,0.015684465563881998,0,0.031368931127763997,-0.047053396691645995,0.015684465563881998,-0.015684465563881998,0,0,0,0,0,-0.015684465563881998,0.031368931127763997,0,0.031368931127763997,0,0,-0.12547572451105599,0,-0.06273786225552799,0.015684465563881998,0,0,0,0.015684465563881998,-0.06273786225552799,0.031368931127763997,-0.015684465563881998,0.06273786225552799,-0.031368931127763997,0.015684465563881998,-0.031368931127763997,0.031368931127763997,0,0,0,0,0,0.015684465563881998,0,0,0,0.031368931127763997,-0.06273786225552799,0,0,0.17252912120270197,-0.031368931127763997,0,0,0,-0.10979125894717398,0,0,0,-0.015684465563881998,0,-0.031368931127763997,0.10979125894717398,-0.015684465563881998,0.21958251789434796,-0.06273786225552799,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.015684465563881998,0,0,-0.015684465563881998,0,0,0,0,0.015684465563881998,0,0,0,0.047053396691645995,0,0.015684465563881998,0,0.015684465563881998,0,0,0,0.031368931127763997,0,0,0,0.015684465563881998,-0.015684465563881998,0,-0.015684465563881998,0,0,0,-0.015684465563881998,0,-0.031368931127763997,0.015684465563881998,0,0.015684465563881998,-0.015684465563881998,0,-0.031368931127763997,0,-0.047053396691645995,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.047053396691645995,0,0,0,0,0.031368931127763997,-0.07842232781941,0,0,0,0,0,-0.047053396691645995,0.15684465563882,0,0.047053396691645995,-0.12547572451105599,0,0,0.015684465563881998,0,0.06273786225552799,0,0.047053396691645995,0,0,-0.141160190074938,0,-0.015684465563881998,0.031368931127763997,0,0,-0.015684465563881998,0,0,0,0,0,-0.015684465563881998,0,-0.031368931127763997,0.06273786225552799,-0.015684465563881998,0.141160190074938,0,0,-0.015684465563881998,0,-0.09410679338329199,0,0,0,-0.047053396691645995,0,0,0.12547572451105599,0,0,0,0,0,0.015684465563881998,0,0,0,0,-0.015684465563881998,0,-0.09410679338329199,0,0,0,0,0.015684465563881998,-0.031368931127763997,0,0,0.031368931127763997,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.09410679338329199,0,0,0,-0.06273786225552799,0.015684465563881998,-0.015684465563881998,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.015684465563881998,0,-0.031368931127763997,0,0,0.015684465563881998,-0.015684465563881998,0,-0.015684465563881998,0.047053396691645995,0,0.031368931127763997,-0.015684465563881998,0,0,0.031368931127763997,0,0,0,0,-0.047053396691645995,0.015684465563881998,-0.031368931127763997,0.031368931127763997,0,0.23526698345822997,-0.07842232781941,0,-0.031368931127763997,0,0,0.07842232781941,-0.015684465563881998,0.015684465563881998,0,0,0,0.031368931127763997,0,0.047053396691645995,-0.06273786225552799,0,0,0.09410679338329199,0,0.031368931127763997,-0.031368931127763997,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-4-1","text":">

I started doing biochemistry shortly after that, which was extracting pigments from leaves and petals and so on, and actually discovering that anthocyanin pigments actually responded to pH and, needless to say, that was not an original discovery.","section":8,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0644825880219161,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0644825880219161,0,0.1289651760438322,0,0.03224129401095805,-0.1289651760438322,0,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0.3224129401095805,0,0,0,0,-0.0644825880219161,0,0,0.22568905807670636,0,0.5481019981862869,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0,0.03224129401095805,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,-0.09672388203287416,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0644825880219161,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0.16120647005479025,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0644825880219161,0.03224129401095805,0,0.03224129401095805,-0.0644825880219161,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,-0.09672388203287416,0.03224129401095805,0,0.03224129401095805,-0.1289651760438322,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09672388203287416,0,0,0,0.03224129401095805,-0.0644825880219161,0,-0.0644825880219161,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0,0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0.1289651760438322,0,0,0,0,-0.09672388203287416,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0644825880219161,0.0644825880219161,0,0.29017164609862245,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0644825880219161,0,0,0,0,-0.0644825880219161,0,0,0.0644825880219161,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,-0.1289651760438322,0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0,0,0.03224129401095805,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0.03224129401095805,-0.03224129401095805,0.22568905807670636,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0.03224129401095805,-0.03224129401095805,0.03224129401095805,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0,0.09672388203287416,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0.09672388203287416,0,0,0,0.03224129401095805,0,0.03224129401095805,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0.0644825880219161,-0.0644825880219161,0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0.03224129401095805,0,0.09672388203287416,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,-0.03224129401095805,0,-0.09672388203287416,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0644825880219161,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03224129401095805,0,0.03224129401095805,0,0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09672388203287416,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03224129401095805,0,0.03224129401095805,0,0.0644825880219161,0,0,-0.03224129401095805,0.29017164609862245,0,0.03224129401095805,-0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03224129401095805,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-9-1","text":"> In the meantime, I had progressed through school and as... we did not have much choice; we would always pursue a standard curriculum, and the subjects that we did was English, Afrikaans – which was the other language there – Latin, general science, history and mathematics.

If you can get hold of a book that told you... introduced you to how to do it, you could just go and do it. > > So that is something I think that I have kept with me all my life because I've never learnt anything from going to courses. If I want to learn a new subject, I get a book and I start doing it. And it's advice I've always gived... I mean, when I got interested in computing in the early '60s, I started by learning an assembly language and actually programming a computer because there's... and I think in today's environment where nobody can learn anything unless they go to a course, or do this in a formal sense, I just never had that since there was no one really to teach me, and so I had cultivated – not cultivated, it had just come, probably out of necessity combined with inclination – just the idea that knowledge is out there; it's available. If you can't buy the book you can always go to the public library and steal it if necessary. So, I think that that is... and I think that's one of the most important things, to become a scientist.","section":11,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0,0,0.036860489038724284,0,0.036860489038724284,0,0.055290733558086426,0,0,0,0.055290733558086426,0,0,-0.018430244519362142,0.09215122259681072,0,0.14744195615489714,-0.036860489038724284,0.018430244519362142,-0.09215122259681072,0.018430244519362142,-0.018430244519362142,0.036860489038724284,0,0.5529073355808642,0,0,0,0,-0.018430244519362142,0,-0.018430244519362142,0.2211629342323457,0,0.3501746458678807,0,0,-0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0,0.036860489038724284,0,0,0,0,-0.036860489038724284,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018430244519362142,0,0,0.036860489038724284,-0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0,0.055290733558086426,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0.036860489038724284,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018430244519362142,0,0,-0.09215122259681072,0,0,0.018430244519362142,-0.055290733558086426,0,-0.018430244519362142,0.055290733558086426,-0.036860489038724284,0,0,0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.036860489038724284,0.018430244519362142,0,0.018430244519362142,0,0.036860489038724284,0,0,-0.036860489038724284,0,0,0,-0.129011711635535,0,0,0,-0.018430244519362142,0.036860489038724284,-0.055290733558086426,0,0,0.018430244519362142,0,0,-0.018430244519362142,0.018430244519362142,-0.036860489038724284,0,-0.036860489038724284,0,0,0.018430244519362142,-0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,-0.018430244519362142,0,0,0.018430244519362142,0,0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0,0,0.129011711635535,0,0,0,0.018430244519362142,0,0,-0.018430244519362142,0,-0.07372097807744857,0,-0.018430244519362142,0.055290733558086426,0,0.3501746458678807,-0.018430244519362142,0,-0.018430244519362142,0,-0.018430244519362142,0,0,0.055290733558086426,0,0,0,0.129011711635535,0,0,0,0,-0.018430244519362142,0.07372097807744857,0,0,0,0,0,0.036860489038724284,0,0,0,0.018430244519362142,-0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0,0,-0.036860489038724284,0,-0.018430244519362142,0,0,0.018430244519362142,0,0,-0.055290733558086426,0,0,0,-0.09215122259681072,0,-0.055290733558086426,0,-0.14744195615489714,0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0,-0.07372097807744857,0,0,0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0,-0.018430244519362142,0,0,0.018430244519362142,-0.018430244519362142,0.07372097807744857,0,0,-0.036860489038724284,0,0,0,-0.018430244519362142,0,0,0.036860489038724284,0,0,-0.036860489038724284,0,0,0,0,0.036860489038724284,0,0.07372097807744857,0,0,0,0.018430244519362142,0,0,-0.055290733558086426,0,0,0.2211629342323457,-0.018430244519362142,0.036860489038724284,0,0.018430244519362142,-0.09215122259681072,0,0,0,-0.018430244519362142,0,0,0.018430244519362142,-0.036860489038724284,0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0,0,0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0,-0.018430244519362142,0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.036860489038724284,0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07372097807744857,0,0,0,0,0.036860489038724284,0,0,0,0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0.07372097807744857,-0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11058146711617285,-0.018430244519362142,0,0,0.25802342327107,-0.036860489038724284,0,-0.09215122259681072,0,0,0.018430244519362142,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.036860489038724284,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-11-3","text":"*[Q] Sydney, it seems you were totally self-motivated.

In fact I've noticed in my own children that they always begin with this interest in nature, of seeds, of having animals swim around and looking down things at magnifying glasses. And then I think it is the formal teaching that destroys this. So if you just take as much of the formal teaching as is necessary to pass examinations, you needn't have this exploratory urge and I think that's one of the things that... that I think is... is science... and of course the fact that there is a way of actually asking and answering questions about nature. > > Well, the Wells book covers everything that was known about biology and so there was the whole thing about physiology, about how things worked, and how things worked seemed to me to be very important.

People couldn't stand to be with him. > > When Joe- I remember when Joe went to Accra - he left Johannesburg and went to Accra - we had just come to London, this was in the fifties, he left just after Sharpville. We used to say- any day and N'Kruma is going to arrive in London and say please let me in, and people were saying- why do you want to be here? He said- it's this guy Gilman, I can't stand him any longer, I've just got to get out. > > But that is the thing, and I still see friends of mine who went through this period, like Ben Kaminer who just, you know go back to those days and another- and so, Joe I think was a great formative influence. I think he was too much of a person who- he certainly was not an experimentalist in the sense that I had become one, you know, he was a great describer, his thesis was on the Golgi Apparatus and he had done- I mean there were all kinds of strange connections. > > For example, he started nutritional work. One of my jobs was actually to make amino acids, because of course we were doing nutrition on rats there, but we couldn't - it was during the war - we couldn't make amino acids. So, I actually manufactured Cysteine and Tryptophan by the classic methods. Cysteine from a barber, from the barber's shop, from human hair. There is a classical description of how to make Cysteine, and actually, Tryptophan from milk and Gowland Hopkins is, is someone who had given all those descriptions, so I had learnt to make amino acids and so on.","section":18,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.06976744186046512,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,-0.09302325581395349,0.023255813953488372,0,0.11627906976744186,0,0.06976744186046512,0,0,-0.09302325581395349,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,-0.023255813953488372,0.3023255813953488,0,0,0,0,0,0.046511627906976744,0,0.32558139534883723,0,0.3488372093023256,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,0.023255813953488372,-0.09302325581395349,0,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,0.023255813953488372,0,0.023255813953488372,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0.09302325581395349,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.09302325581395349,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0.023255813953488372,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0.023255813953488372,0,0.046511627906976744,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,0.06976744186046512,-0.06976744186046512,0.023255813953488372,0,0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,0,0.023255813953488372,-0.023255813953488372,0.046511627906976744,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0.023255813953488372,-0.13953488372093023,0,0,0.023255813953488372,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0.046511627906976744,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0.06976744186046512,-0.023255813953488372,0,-0.023255813953488372,0.023255813953488372,-0.023255813953488372,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0.023255813953488372,-0.046511627906976744,0,0,0.13953488372093023,0,0.046511627906976744,0,0,-0.09302325581395349,0,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0.09302325581395349,0,0.13953488372093023,-0.046511627906976744,0.023255813953488372,-0.046511627906976744,0.023255813953488372,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06976744186046512,0,0,0.023255813953488372,-0.06976744186046512,0,0,0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,0,0.023255813953488372,-0.046511627906976744,0,0,0,0,0.023255813953488372,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,-0.09302325581395349,0.023255813953488372,-0.13953488372093023,0,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0.023255813953488372,0,0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,0,0.06976744186046512,0,0.32558139534883723,0,0,-0.09302325581395349,0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0.023255813953488372,0,0.023255813953488372,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,0,0.023255813953488372,0,0.046511627906976744,-0.046511627906976744,0,0,0.06976744186046512,-0.023255813953488372,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,-0.13953488372093023,0,0,0,-0.06976744186046512,0,0,0.023255813953488372,-0.06976744186046512,0.046511627906976744,-0.046511627906976744,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,-0.046511627906976744,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11627906976744186,0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2558139534883721,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,0.023255813953488372,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0.06976744186046512,0,0,0,0,-0.11627906976744186,0,-0.023255813953488372,0,-0.046511627906976744,0,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0.023255813953488372,-0.023255813953488372,0.023255813953488372,-0.046511627906976744,0,0,0.06976744186046512,0,0.023255813953488372,0,0,-0.046511627906976744,0,-0.046511627906976744,0.046511627906976744,0,0.046511627906976744,0,0.023255813953488372,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0.3488372093023256,-0.046511627906976744,0,0,0,-0.023255813953488372,0.13953488372093023,0,0.046511627906976744,-0.023255813953488372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-19-1","text":"> Now a very important person in my South African life is someone- that is **Seymour Papert**.

And this had come because I discovered a book which is up there on the shelf- no, no- and which is called *\"Perspectives in Biochemistry\"*.","section":20,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07511157661886797,0,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0.07511157661886797,0,0.07511157661886797,0,0,-0.07511157661886797,0,0,0,-0.037555788309433985,0.33800209478490584,-0.11266736492830196,0,-0.07511157661886797,0,-0.07511157661886797,0.07511157661886797,0,0.2628905181660379,-0.07511157661886797,0.2628905181660379,-0.037555788309433985,0,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0.037555788309433985,0,0,-0.037555788309433985,0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0.037555788309433985,-0.037555788309433985,0.07511157661886797,-0.07511157661886797,0,-0.07511157661886797,0,0,0,0,0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07511157661886797,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.037555788309433985,0.07511157661886797,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,-0.11266736492830196,0.2253347298566039,0,0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11266736492830196,0,0,0,0,0.037555788309433985,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0,0,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11266736492830196,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.037555788309433985,0,0.037555788309433985,0,0.11266736492830196,-0.037555788309433985,0,-0.07511157661886797,0.07511157661886797,-0.07511157661886797,0.037555788309433985,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0,0,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0,0.2253347298566039,0,0.07511157661886797,0,0.037555788309433985,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0,0,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0.37555788309433985,0,0,0,0.037555788309433985,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0.07511157661886797,0,0,0,0,0,0.07511157661886797,0,0.07511157661886797,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.037555788309433985,-0.037555788309433985,0,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.037555788309433985,0,-0.18777894154716993,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07511157661886797,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18777894154716993,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0,0.037555788309433985,0,0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07511157661886797,0,0.037555788309433985,0,0.037555788309433985,-0.15022315323773594,0,0,0,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0.037555788309433985,-0.07511157661886797,0,0,0.07511157661886797,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11266736492830196,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11266736492830196,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.037555788309433985,0.037555788309433985,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.037555788309433985,0,0,-0.037555788309433985,0.037555788309433985,0,0,0,0.3004463064754719,-0.037555788309433985,0,-0.037555788309433985,0,-0.037555788309433985,0.11266736492830196,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.037555788309433985,0,0,0.07511157661886797,0,0.037555788309433985,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-21-1","text":"> What had happened was we had lectures on where bile pigments came from.

In fact, during my second year anatomy... in those days we actually spent a whole year doing human dissection. There's none of this present style where you look it up in a book or a database; we actually dissected, and we actually had to know everything in the human body, because that is the way you did anatomy in the old days. There's a very remarkable professor of anatomy there, called **Raymond Dart**, who I'll come back to again. > > And... and also... so, now at the time this was an English language university – the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg – there were no Afrikaans speaking universities where people could do medicine or dentistry at that time, and so there were a lot of Afrikaaners came to this... came to do medicine here. And because of the nature of South African politics at the time, people were very careful as to who they put at a... at a dissection table. There were six of us, three on each side of the body when we changed places at this... and so I was assigned to a table with five Afrikaaners, because of my name; they had thought from my name I must be an Afrikaaner. > > One of the people I did keep up with, he later became a professor of dentistry in South Africa, a man called Dreyer. However, there I was, and they refused to speak English, so I learnt Afrikaans. I became fully bilingual. In fact, it stood me in great stead, because I could always get a booking on a railway train just by asking for it in Afrikaans. I became fully bilingual because we just spoke Afrikaans. Of course, I could speak quite a bit of it because I had played at school with Afrikaans... Afrikaaners and so on, but here I became fully bilingual. And in fact, I do have an accent which is still... and in my English accent, is still rather Afrikaans accent – not the usual kind of Jo'burg accent. > > So I had... I learnt anatomy, and I'd been to lectures during my course on histology because we had to do the whole of histology. And there was a remarkable man there called Joe Gillman who really believed in science and so on, and so I found this field of being able to look down a microscope, and actually see cells, completely fascinating. > > Now, when I think back of what we had to do in 40 weeks... because medical students worked hard. We had 40 weeks; it was eight o'clock... 8.00am to 5.00pm every day, many laboratory sessions. We had to learn anthropology, we had to learn palaeontology, a little bit of it, we had to learn the whole of histology, neurology, human embryology and be willing to answer questions on it, plus the whole of physiology. And all to be accomplished within one year.","section":22,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.06960997164655913,0,0.017402492911639783,0,0,0,0,0,0.12181745038147848,-0.034804985823279566,0.034804985823279566,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0.06960997164655913,-0.1044149574698387,0,0,0.1914274220280376,-0.017402492911639783,0.1044149574698387,-0.08701246455819892,0,-0.13921994329311826,0.017402492911639783,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0.3132448724095161,-0.05220747873491935,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,-0.034804985823279566,0.05220747873491935,0,0.3132448724095161,-0.017402492911639783,0.2958423794978763,-0.034804985823279566,0.017402492911639783,-0.06960997164655913,0.017402492911639783,0,0,0,0.017402492911639783,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,-0.034804985823279566,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.034804985823279566,0,0,-0.05220747873491935,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,-0.034804985823279566,0.017402492911639783,0,0.017402492911639783,-0.017402492911639783,0.1044149574698387,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,0,0.034804985823279566,0,0,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0.034804985823279566,-0.017402492911639783,0.034804985823279566,-0.034804985823279566,0,-0.017402492911639783,0.017402492911639783,0,0,0,0.05220747873491935,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017402492911639783,-0.034804985823279566,0.017402492911639783,0,0.017402492911639783,0,0.06960997164655913,-0.05220747873491935,0,0,0.017402492911639783,0,0.05220747873491935,-0.034804985823279566,0.017402492911639783,-0.017402492911639783,0,0,0,-0.1044149574698387,0.05220747873491935,0,0.034804985823279566,-0.017402492911639783,0,0,0.034804985823279566,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0.017402492911639783,-0.1044149574698387,0,0,0.017402492911639783,-0.034804985823279566,0,-0.1044149574698387,0.017402492911639783,-0.017402492911639783,0.1044149574698387,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0.05220747873491935,-0.05220747873491935,0,-0.017402492911639783,0.24363490076295696,-0.05220747873491935,0.017402492911639783,0,0.05220747873491935,-0.017402492911639783,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,0,0.034804985823279566,0,0.12181745038147848,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0.034804985823279566,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,0,0,0,0.034804985823279566,0,0,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0.05220747873491935,0,0.06960997164655913,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,0,0.017402492911639783,0,0.034804985823279566,-0.034804985823279566,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017402492911639783,-0.034804985823279566,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,0,0.017402492911639783,-0.034804985823279566,0,0,0,-0.13921994329311826,0,-0.17402492911639783,0,-0.06960997164655913,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,-0.017402492911639783,0.034804985823279566,0,0,-0.034804985823279566,0,-0.034804985823279566,0.017402492911639783,0,0.017402492911639783,-0.034804985823279566,0,0,0.08701246455819892,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,0,0,0,0.034804985823279566,0,0,0,0,-0.05220747873491935,0,0,0,0,0.034804985823279566,0,0,0,0.034804985823279566,0,0.034804985823279566,0,0,0,0.017402492911639783,0,0.12181745038147848,0,0,0,0,-0.06960997164655913,0,0,0,-0.034804985823279566,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.034804985823279566,0,0,0,0.017402492911639783,0,0,0,0.017402492911639783,-0.24363490076295696,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,-0.017402492911639783,0.017402492911639783,0,0,0,0.017402492911639783,-0.06960997164655913,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,-0.05220747873491935,0,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0.017402492911639783,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017402492911639783,0,0,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0.06960997164655913,-0.017402492911639783,0,-0.034804985823279566,0,0,0,0,0.017402492911639783,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0.08701246455819892,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0.43506232279099455,-0.06960997164655913,0.034804985823279566,-0.017402492911639783,0,0,0.05220747873491935,0,0,-0.017402492911639783,0,0,0,0,0,-0.034804985823279566,0.05220747873491935,0,0.017402492911639783,0,0.017402492911639783,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-23-1","text":"> Now, during the course of this year, it had become realised that if I just went on and did my six years medicine, I would finish medicine under the age of 21 and that I couldn't become registered at that time – you had to be over 21 to become a registered doctor. And so therefore I would have to spend a year doing something else. > > And one of the things that was available, which fitted in very nicely with everything, was a... a BSc degree. And of course the people who paid my bursary realised that I would have to do this in order... so they gave me an extra year. And I therefore deviated at the end of the second year to do a BSc in physiology and anatomy. > > And a small group of people did this each year... into this class, and one suddenly realised that now one was entering in... into science, because there were in that – especially in the histology department – a number of people who had not only done a BSc degree, but had done an Honours degree and a Masters degree and that they began to run the BSc class, and in this department people were actually doing research. > > And one of my teachers there was a remarkable man called Harold Daitz, who died quite young in... later on. Another man was a man called Mike Wright, who was about a year ahead of me, and who had gone on to do neuroanatomy. And so in that year, one really began to do research. That is, we all were put in a room and we were... all had a... I think there were about 11 of us. > > And two of my colleagues I still keep in touch with from that time; I saw one recently who had just retired as professor of anaesthesiology in University of... at Washington University in Seattle – University of Washington in Seattle. And this was absolutely an amazing experience because on the anatomy side, we had lectures in palaeontology from Robert Broom, and I still have a copy of his... of a book he gave me. > > We did a whole series of sessions with people in the department and that we were taught about the physics and chemistry of dyes as a basis of staining of tissue. My teacher here was someone who remained a friend for life, who was Joel Mandelstam. He had... he was a chemist who had joined Joe Gillman's department to do research and tried to do biochemistry there. > > We did projects in embryology, in... involving three-dimensional reconstruction of embryos from serial sections, traced out with a Camera Lucida onto sheets of beeswax and the thing stacked, and this technology I learnt. I also did a project in neuroanatomy and did a reconstruction of part of a galago brain, and it was absolutely the... a tremendous experience. > > On the physiology part we started to do some more biochemistry. Now one thing we could do was take up some project of our own... and from my reading in various books, I had become tremendously impressed by trying to work on cell physiology... on enzymology. And one of the things that was done in those days, was to measure oxygen uptake – that was the only way you could study oxidation and reduction pathways. You had manometers and you would add these enzymes and the things, and you would shake them, and you would watch to see the changes in pressure. > > And – there were two kinds – there was a thing called a Warburg manometer, and everybody worked with these, and of course there wasn't such a thing available, so I decided I'd build one, and I sat down and I first had to learn how to blow glass and grind tabs. So I actually did build a Warburg manometer and measure the oxygen uptake of tissues and this led me to say, 'Now I know what I want to do; I want to become a cell physiologist'. And I had become interested then in trying to find out now how cells could work and how... and how this... how one could do... how one could penetrate

Most of my colleagues did, but I decided I was more interested in this, and so I would stay on and do an Honours degree. And so that's exactly what I did. Now of course my bursary was suspended, but I got a job in the department as a technician. That is, I was paid in lieu of fees, and I also was paid a small salary, and what I essentially did was make a whole set of teaching slides of the human body – histology, helping a technician. > > So I learnt how to embed human tissue, and, for that matter, animal tissue, but any tissue. I learnt how to section these. I learnt how to stain them and mount them, and so I became a... essentially histology technician and I used to go and work there in the department doing all of this. > > It is there also that I discovered the wonders of **Puccini's fluid**. Now, Puccini's fluid is nothing to do with the opera. Puccini's fluid was a preservative that was consisted of 70%... sorry, one part of 95% alcohol and one part of glycerine, and I had made this up and I was, I think, preserving some tissue in it or clearing it or something... I decided to have a taste of this stuff. > > And of course glycerine is exactly what you need to cut the taste, the bite of the alcohol and Puccini's fluid, which after having a taste, I... this was a Saturday afternoon – I woke up on the floor of the laboratory Sunday morning, still holding this 100cc measuring cylinder – I'd taken much more than a taste of it. > > But it actually is the best way to make lab cocktails. And a very good formula is absolute ethanol, and one should not use 100% actually because that has been cleaned by cold distillation with benzene, so it's pretty poisonous. 95% is good enough and one part of that, one part of glycerol and one part of orange juice or something like this, makes something that is so smooth, so tasteless and so effective that it's the best thing you can do, and so Puccini's fluid I think has a lot to recommend it. > > Actually, this discovery of the cutting edge of glycols was, as you know, used fairly recently when people were adding ethylene glycol to wine to give it that sort of mature taste. Except ethylene glycol is poisonous – it's... it's what you put in your radiators. You know, there was a scandal some time ago that they were poisoning the wine.

You know, there was the Sterkfontein skull that everybody knew about, and what happened is at 2.00am one morning, I got what I called the Sterkfontein hand, and this was a royal flush. It's the first and only time I got it – I cleaned them out of their toilet paper scrip, but that's the only thing I ever discovered from this excavation, was the Sterkfontein hand, which was a royal flush in hearts.

And then, of course, later on as we went on more and more archaeological expeditions... so this opened up this whole incredible country, and coming from a small, urban thing where the... everything... there was no nature, no... nothing to see, this was one of the most incredible eye-openers of the time.","section":31,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,0,-0.01837415911436567,0,0,0.05512247734309701,0,0,0,0,-0.03674831822873134,0.01837415911436567,-0.01837415911436567,0,0,0.05512247734309701,-0.01837415911436567,0.01837415911436567,0,0.01837415911436567,-0.05512247734309701,0,0,0.03674831822873134,-0.05512247734309701,0.4593539778591418,-0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,-0.03674831822873134,0.01837415911436567,0,0.3307348640585821,0,0.3858573414016791,-0.01837415911436567,0,-0.09187079557182835,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07349663645746268,0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,0.01837415911436567,-0.03674831822873134,0,0,0,0,0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,0,-0.03674831822873134,0,0,0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,0,-0.01837415911436567,0,-0.01837415911436567,0,0,0.12861911380055968,-0.01837415911436567,0,0,0.03674831822873134,-0.01837415911436567,0.01837415911436567,0,0,-0.01837415911436567,0,-0.01837415911436567,0.01837415911436567,-0.01837415911436567,0.01837415911436567,0,0.07349663645746268,-0.03674831822873134,0.07349663645746268,-0.01837415911436567,0,0,0.01837415911436567,-0.01837415911436567,0,-0.01837415911436567,0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,0,-0.11024495468619402,0,-0.03674831822873134,0,0,0.03674831822873134,0,0,-0.03674831822873134,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01837415911436567,0,-0.07349663645746268,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03674831822873134,0,0.01837415911436567,-0.01837415911436567,0.05512247734309701,0,0,-0.01837415911436567,0.01837415911436567,-0.01837415911436567,0,-0.01837415911436567,0,0,0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,0,-0.01837415911436567,0,0,0.20211575025802236,0,0.01837415911436567,0,0.01837415911436567,-0.12861911380055968,0,0,0,-0.01837415911436567,0,-0.05512247734309701,0,0,0.23886406848675373,0,0,-0.01837415911436567,0.01837415911436567,-0.01837415911436567,0.01837415911436567,-0.01837415911436567,0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01837415911436567,0,0.03674831822873134,0,0.03674831822873134,0,0,-0.03674831822873134,0,-0.01837415911436567,0,-0.01837415911436567,0,-0.01837415911436567,0.03674831822873134,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01837415911436567,0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,0.01837415911436567,0,0.03674831822873134,0,0,0,0,-0.07349663645746268,0,-0.11024495468619402,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03674831822873134,0,-0.01837415911436567,0.22048990937238805,0,0,-0.03674831822873134,0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,0.01837415911436567,0,0,-0.01837415911436567,0,0,0.01837415911436567,0,0.01837415911436567,0,0.05512247734309701,0,0.03674831822873134,0,0.03674831822873134,-0.07349663645746268,0,-0.01837415911436567,0.09187079557182835,0,0,-0.01837415911436567,0,-0.07349663645746268,0,-0.01837415911436567,0.01837415911436567,-0.01837415911436567,0.03674831822873134,0,0.05512247734309701,0,0,0,0.03674831822873134,0,0,-0.01837415911436567,0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,0,-0.12861911380055968,0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01837415911436567,0,0,-0.01837415911436567,0.11024495468619402,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01837415911436567,0,-0.03674831822873134,0,0,0.01837415911436567,-0.01837415911436567,0.05512247734309701,0,0,-0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,-0.05512247734309701,0,-0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,-0.01837415911436567,0.03674831822873134,0,0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,0.12861911380055968,-0.01837415911436567,0,0,0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,0.03674831822873134,-0.01837415911436567,0.07349663645746268,-0.01837415911436567,0.07349663645746268,-0.07349663645746268,0,-0.01837415911436567,0.3307348640585821,-0.05512247734309701,0,0,0,0,0.01837415911436567,0,0.01837415911436567,0,0,0,0,0,0.03674831822873134,-0.03674831822873134,0,0,0.03674831822873134,0,0.03674831822873134,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-32-1","text":"> I then had developed this... this very great interest in archaeology and palaeontology, and so going out on these camps had become a regular thing, and in fact I went... in 1947, I went on an expedition with a man called Bosazzar and another man called Ray Adie, both of whom were geologists.

In fact I learnt quite a lot of geology. In fact, I'd become quite an expert on it and did later... and in 1947 or '48, I can't remember, when a big expedition came out from the University of California who wanted to see all the sights, I went with them and I went essentially as a guide, and that's where I met – because they'd asked him to go – **Alex du Toit**. Alex du Toit, as it would be called in French, but du Toit as we called it, was one of the most remarkable people. He is the... one of the great inventors of Gondwanaland, he's... with Wegener, and his book, *The Geology of South Africa*, of which I have a copy, is in fact the whole of the idea of the wandering continents, and he had come to the conclusion of geology alone that Africa and South America were once joined up. > > Now, he had a most remarkable life. He was already quite an old man when I met him, and he had gone out to survey the Kalahari Desert – which is where we went – as a young man for the geological survey in about 1890. In fact, the geological maps were the ones he made. And he turned up there dressed like, I would say, a Dutch Reform Church preacher. He was dressed in a black suit with a waistcoat and a tie and a hat. Now, all the Americans had come out you know, in expedition outfits with... with bush hats with little leopard skin rings. I had come out in my thing, which was shorts and boots and a shirt and a hat because we wore this, but du Toit had come there dressed in this beautiful suit. > > And I remember that one wonderful thing that happened on this trip was we were going along a road in the Kalahari Desert, in the middle of nowhere, and the people were asking about water divination, so he said he believes in it. So they said, 'You, a scientist; you believe in water divination?' He says, 'Yes'. He says, 'Just stop the car here'. He says, 'I'll show it to you, prove it to you'. So stop the car apparently in the middle of nowhere, and he gets out of the car and he cuts a branch, and he goes about... does this sort of tremendous amount of formality and ritual, and then he walks along the road and the thing bends. And he says, 'Well', he says, 'this means there must be water somewhere, so there should be a fault line somewhere here, and if we just go off down here, let's go and look for it'. And sure enough, we go down there and there's this thing, which... there's a little... little spring there – it had dried up, but you could see there had been a spring there. So all these Americans were amazingly impressed by this. > > And when we were going back, he started to tell me in Afrikaans how he came through here as a young man in about 1890 on an ox wagon doing... making the geological survey of this region and that he had found the spring here and that he recognised the topography of the land while we were talking. So I found this to be very amazing thing. However, he had a... this gives one an eye for country. It gives one an eye that one can look at a... at... at the topography and see its history in it. And of course, as you may imagine, this was threatening to become another profession and so I decided to give it up. > > And a colleague of mine who was one year behind me, Philip Tobias, he decided that he would continue it and I've always enjoyed it as a hobby; I've always enjoyed... I've just enjoyed the idea that one can go out and look at a country and of course extract its history from it, and of course that's another interest of course I've had in astronomy.","section":32,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.05789736714235481,0,0,0,0,-0.011579473428470962,0.011579473428470962,0,0.04631789371388385,-0.011579473428470962,0,0,0,-0.08105631399929673,0,-0.023158946856941923,0,0,0.13895368114165155,0,0.04631789371388385,0,0,-0.0926357874277677,0.023158946856941923,0,0.023158946856941923,0,0.4515994637103675,0,0,-0.04631789371388385,0,-0.011579473428470962,0.023158946856941923,-0.011579473428470962,0.1273742077131806,-0.011579473428470962,0.44001999028189653,-0.03473842028541289,0,-0.04631789371388385,0,-0.011579473428470962,0.011579473428470962,-0.023158946856941923,0,0,0,-0.011579473428470962,0,-0.023158946856941923,0.03473842028541289,0,0,0,0.011579473428470962,-0.011579473428470962,0,0,0,0,0.05789736714235481,0,0,-0.03473842028541289,0,-0.011579473428470962,0.03473842028541289,-0.023158946856941923,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06947684057082577,0,0,0.011579473428470962,-0.011579473428470962,0.04631789371388385,-0.03473842028541289,0,0,0.011579473428470962,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.011579473428470962,0,-0.03473842028541289,0,-0.04631789371388385,0,-0.08105631399929673,0.04631789371388385,-0.011579473428470962,0,-0.023158946856941923,0.06947684057082577,0,0,0,0.011579473428470962,0,0,0,0.011579473428470962,-0.0926357874277677,0,-0.011579473428470962,0.04631789371388385,0,0.011579473428470962,0,0,0,0,0,0.011579473428470962,-0.011579473428470962,0,0,0.011579473428470962,-0.011579473428470962,0.011579473428470962,-0.1273742077131806,0.011579473428470962,-0.023158946856941923,0.011579473428470962,0,0,0,0.023158946856941923,-0.011579473428470962,0.03473842028541289,-0.011579473428470962,0.03473842028541289,-0.011579473428470962,0,-0.06947684057082577,0.06947684057082577,-0.023158946856941923,0,-0.011579473428470962,0,-0.023158946856941923,0.03473842028541289,0,0,0,0.011579473428470962,0,0,-0.011579473428470962,0.23158946856941923,0,0,0,0.011579473428470962,-0.04631789371388385,0,0,0,-0.023158946856941923,0,-0.011579473428470962,0.03473842028541289,0,0.19685104828400635,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.011579473428470962,0,0.011579473428470962,-0.011579473428470962,0,0,0,-0.03473842028541289,0.011579473428470962,0,0.05789736714235481,-0.011579473428470962,0.023158946856941923,-0.023158946856941923,0.05789736714235481,-0.011579473428470962,0,0,0.011579473428470962,0,0,-0.011579473428470962,0.023158946856941923,0,0.011579473428470962,0,0,0,0.011579473428470962,0,0,0,0.023158946856941923,0,0.011579473428470962,-0.011579473428470962,0,-0.023158946856941923,0,-0.11579473428470961,0,-0.11579473428470961,0,0,0,-0.011579473428470962,0.011579473428470962,-0.03473842028541289,0,0,0,-0.08105631399929673,0,-0.023158946856941923,0,0,0,-0.04631789371388385,0,-0.04631789371388385,0.08105631399929673,0,0,-0.023158946856941923,0,-0.011579473428470962,0,-0.04631789371388385,0.03473842028541289,0,0,0,0,-0.023158946856941923,0.03473842028541289,-0.011579473428470962,0,0,0.023158946856941923,0,0.011579473428470962,0,0.011579473428470962,-0.023158946856941923,0.011579473428470962,0,0,-0.03473842028541289,0,0,0.19685104828400635,0,0.023158946856941923,0,0,-0.03473842028541289,0,0,0,-0.03473842028541289,0.023158946856941923,-0.023158946856941923,0.03473842028541289,-0.04631789371388385,0.011579473428470962,0,0.04631789371388385,0,0,0,0.023158946856941923,0,0,-0.03473842028541289,0.011579473428470962,-0.11579473428470961,0.011579473428470962,0,0,0,0.011579473428470962,0,0.011579473428470962,0,0.023158946856941923,0,0,0,0.34738420285412885,-0.023158946856941923,0.011579473428470962,0,0,-0.011579473428470962,0.03473842028541289,0,0,-0.04631789371388385,0,-0.023158946856941923,0,-0.05789736714235481,0.04631789371388385,0,0.011579473428470962,0,0.011579473428470962,-0.011579473428470962,0,-0.06947684057082577,0,0,0.011579473428470962,0,0,0,0.011579473428470962,-0.011579473428470962,0,-0.023158946856941923,0,0,0.08105631399929673,-0.023158946856941923,0,0,0.023158946856941923,0,0,0,0.011579473428470962,0,0.06947684057082577,0,0.03473842028541289,-0.011579473428470962,0,0,0.2547484154263612,-0.08105631399929673,0.011579473428470962,0,0.03473842028541289,0,0.03473842028541289,0,0,-0.011579473428470962,0,0,0,0,0.011579473428470962,-0.03473842028541289,0,0,0,0,0,-0.023158946856941923,0,-0.011579473428470962]},{"id":"transcript-33-1","text":"> Astronomy I'm a complete amateur. I got interested in this... of course, if you live in the southern hemisphere you can't... you can't but be interested in the sky, and of course I would say that most of my interest in the stars was as a... an assiduous reader of science fiction. I became... from about the age of eight – seven or eight – I became a reader of science fiction and this had come about... if I can go back to there... > > One of my mother's brothers was... was rather wealthy; that is, he had done well. He had a shop in Fordsburg where he sold first bicycles and then... and then radios, and he had done very well, Uncle Harry, and was not married. And I used to go and visit him and one of the things that there was in the street in Fordsburg was... Fordsburg was a suburb of... of Johannesburg, next to an equally depressed area called Mayfair, surprisingly enough, just out on the western suburbs and was inhabited by a lot of people, mostly poor whites then, who had come in as being displaced from the land, had come into the city, mostly Afrikaaners who had come in as a result of the agricultural depression in the thirties. And so they... they were the clientele there, and my uncle would always take me for lunch to the Fordsburg Hotel – which is where he had his lunch – where we'd have something that I think you can only get in South Africa called a mixed grill, and I actually knew someone who could eat three South African mixed grills and... and survive, but still. > > And then he would give me some money – half a crown, which was, well, amazing – and I would go to this second-hand bookstore where this person had past numbers of something called *Amazing Stories* which you could buy for about tuppence each. These were the pulp magazines – there were two of them which were the best; one was called *Amazing Stories*; other called *Astounding Stories*. They came from... they came from... America and I collected these and this is where I encountered, you know, all the great names – Robert Heinlein and so on. > > And I still have an enormous collection of science fiction. In fact, this stood me very well in later years, when Francis Crick wrote a paper on the idea of Pangenesis, namely that all life... Panspermia, I'm sorry – that all life had been brought here from outer space and the planet seeded. I told him that I'd read this somewhere before, and he said that was very interesting, could I give him the reference. I said, well, I can't remember the exact number, but it was *Amazing Stories*, either 1936 or 1937, I'm sure you could find... find it there; it's been published before and he should be careful, you know, not to be accused of plagiarism. > > However... but this again was, you know, an interesting... another way of looking at the world and of course in the early days it was the kind of small boy interest. But in later years I... I liked this a lot for what it explored about society and human nature, and I think that some of the inversions, the unexpected inversions... and I can remember two of these, because there's a sort of thinking that I liked... I liked the... I like the playing with words, and the one I think very, very well of is the one written by a man called... August Derleth *[sic]* I think his name is. The title of this article is *How to Serve Man* *[sic]*, and it says that earth is in a terrible state. These people come from outer space and they bring enormous benefits; they give humanity boxes which are endless supplies of energy and they just exude goodness – altruism. Of course, the... the teller of the story is a journalist who is deeply suspicious of all of this and all his friends say, 'No, no, no, these come from another planet; they're completely altruistic; there are no hidden motives', and what is then... they then say their slogan is *How To Serve Man* *[sic]* – that's what they've entitled it – and they have these courses that people get elected for and go and get taken to wonderful places where they get educated and so on, except what is very strange is that no one has ever met anybody who's come back from this. > > And of course, the investigation goes on when he discovers that what these people are really interested in is cooking and eating, and *How to Serve Man* *[sic]* is in fact not only the title of the most important book in their culture but it's a recipe book, and of course that's the end of the story. > > So I think this kind of duality has always appealed to me and there are lots of other cases of it and... and I think their experiments with societies, some of them are, I think, brilliant. *The Space Merchants* I think is a brilliant parody of America; of the future. The only thing in this is, you know, it's come true basically – that's the disappointing

I just began to realise how wrong we'd got everything, because to try and transform that... however, it was just the picture of the times that you'd try your hand at anything, you see, so we did lots of these things as students; it was all very exciting.","section":38,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.043478260869565216,0,0,0,0,0,0.021739130434782608,0,0.06521739130434782,-0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0,0,-0.043478260869565216,0,-0.06521739130434782,0,0,0.10869565217391304,0,0.06521739130434782,0,0.021739130434782608,-0.08695652173913043,0,0,0,0,0.3913043478260869,0,0,-0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,-0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0,0.2608695652173913,0,0.2826086956521739,0,0,0,0.043478260869565216,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.021739130434782608,0,0,0.021739130434782608,0,0.06521739130434782,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.021739130434782608,0,0,-0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,-0.021739130434782608,0,-0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0,0,-0.021739130434782608,0,-0.021739130434782608,0,0,0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0,-0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0,0.021739130434782608,0,0.021739130434782608,0,0,-0.043478260869565216,0,0,0,-0.021739130434782608,0,-0.08695652173913043,0.08695652173913043,-0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0,0,-0.043478260869565216,0,0,0,0,0.021739130434782608,-0.06521739130434782,0,0,0,0,0.021739130434782608,-0.021739130434782608,0,-0.021739130434782608,0,0,0.021739130434782608,-0.06521739130434782,0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0,-0.08695652173913043,0,0,0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0.043478260869565216,0,0.021739130434782608,0,0.021739130434782608,0,0.043478260869565216,-0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0,0,-0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.021739130434782608,0,-0.021739130434782608,0.19565217391304346,0,0.043478260869565216,0,0.06521739130434782,-0.06521739130434782,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.043478260869565216,0,0.2608695652173913,-0.021739130434782608,0,0,0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0.043478260869565216,-0.043478260869565216,0,0,0.06521739130434782,-0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0,0.021739130434782608,0,0.021739130434782608,0,0,-0.021739130434782608,0,-0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0,0,-0.043478260869565216,0,0,0.021739130434782608,-0.021739130434782608,0,-0.021739130434782608,0.08695652173913043,-0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.021739130434782608,0,-0.06521739130434782,0,-0.08695652173913043,0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0,-0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06521739130434782,0,0,0,-0.021739130434782608,0,0,0.30434782608695654,0,0.021739130434782608,-0.043478260869565216,0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.043478260869565216,0,-0.021739130434782608,0.06521739130434782,0,0,0,0,-0.021739130434782608,0,0,0.17391304347826086,-0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0,0.043478260869565216,-0.043478260869565216,0,0,0,-0.06521739130434782,0,0,0.06521739130434782,-0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.021739130434782608,-0.17391304347826086,0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0,-0.06521739130434782,0,0,0.043478260869565216,0,0,0,0.043478260869565216,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.043478260869565216,0,-0.043478260869565216,0,0,0,-0.021739130434782608,0.08695652173913043,0,0,0,0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0.043478260869565216,0,0,0,0,-0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,-0.043478260869565216,0,0,0.15217391304347827,-0.043478260869565216,0.08695652173913043,-0.021739130434782608,0,0,0.021739130434782608,-0.021739130434782608,0,-0.043478260869565216,0.021739130434782608,0,0.043478260869565216,0,0,-0.021739130434782608,0.43478260869565216,0,0.043478260869565216,0,0,0,0.043478260869565216,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0.021739130434782608,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-39-1","text":"> I then... I had a good friend called Tony Allison at the time, who was doing science with me, and Le Gros Clark, who was professor of anatomy at Oxford, came out to South Africa in 1946 to see the anatomical remains – the palaeontological remains. And at this stage, he invited me to go back to Oxford to the anatomy department there, where I could continue to do science, because you... you must remember that a little bit later, Harold Daitz went to Le Gros Clark. So there were those connections between Dart and Le Gros Clark and... he also invited Tony Alison. > > I went to see Raymond Dart and said, 'What shall I do?' And Dart was a very wise man. He was at this time the Dean of the medical school, a great anatomist of the old school, had come from London, had seen Owen and all those people there. So, he said, 'Look, it sounds to me what you're interested in would be called biochemistry, but there are no jobs for people in biochemistry unless they are in medical schools, so what I advise you to do is to go back and finish medicine, and then you can become a biochemist'. And I took a lot of advice from people and everybody said... well, yeah, they agreed; there would be a dead end; there's no future in science as science at that time, because I'm talking about 1947; and the best thing is go back and finish medicine. > > So I had four years to do. So I stayed on in the department doing research and sort of did medicine part-time and... and what I did was I went on working there and used to just polish off the course in the last six weeks of the year, so... because I just was totally uninterested. The first year of going back wasn't too bad because we did pathology and bacteriology and that was still science, I did very well then. But then we started clinical work, and I... I just wasn't suited to that. I didn't like... I didn't like the whole structure of the teaching hospital; that is, I felt very much that treating patients as things is the wrong thing and that since I thought it was very hard to be a scientist and not do this, then I preferred not to do it at all. > > So in fact, I think I'm the only person who's ever passed medicine who had never seen a patient until his examination because I never went, and in fact one of the great stories is that I failed my medicine because I was asked to smell this patient's breath, incorrectly diagnosed Maclean's toothpaste, where I should have diagnosed acetone, you see; so the visiting professor from... the examining professor from Cambridge passed me... failed me.","section":39,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.05334229032174088,-0.017780763440580293,0,-0.017780763440580293,0,0,0,0,0.10668458064348176,0,0,0,0,-0.035561526881160585,0,-0.07112305376232117,0,-0.017780763440580293,0.08890381720290147,0,0.10668458064348176,0,0,-0.14224610752464234,0.017780763440580293,-0.017780763440580293,0,0,0.5334229032174088,-0.08890381720290147,0,0,0,-0.08890381720290147,0.07112305376232117,0,0.30227297848986495,-0.017780763440580293,0.40895755913334675,-0.035561526881160585,0,-0.017780763440580293,0.05334229032174088,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017780763440580293,0,0,0.017780763440580293,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017780763440580293,0.08890381720290147,0,0.017780763440580293,-0.035561526881160585,0.035561526881160585,0,0.017780763440580293,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.035561526881160585,0,0.017780763440580293,0,0.035561526881160585,-0.017780763440580293,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017780763440580293,0,0,0,-0.017780763440580293,0.07112305376232117,0,0,0,0.017780763440580293,-0.017780763440580293,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017780763440580293,-0.017780763440580293,0.07112305376232117,0,0,0,0.035561526881160585,-0.017780763440580293,0.035561526881160585,-0.017780763440580293,0.017780763440580293,0,0.017780763440580293,0,0,0,0.017780763440580293,0,0,-0.05334229032174088,0,0,0,0,0.017780763440580293,-0.08890381720290147,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017780763440580293,-0.07112305376232117,0,0,0.035561526881160585,-0.035561526881160585,0,-0.035561526881160585,0.017780763440580293,-0.05334229032174088,0,-0.017780763440580293,0,-0.017780763440580293,0.07112305376232117,0,0,-0.035561526881160585,0.05334229032174088,0,0,0,0.17780763440580294,0,0.017780763440580293,-0.017780763440580293,0,-0.08890381720290147,0,-0.035561526881160585,0,-0.08890381720290147,0,0,0.035561526881160585,0,0.16002687096522264,-0.035561526881160585,0,0,0.035561526881160585,0,0,-0.035561526881160585,0.05334229032174088,-0.017780763440580293,0.035561526881160585,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08890381720290147,0.035561526881160585,0,0.08890381720290147,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017780763440580293,0.017780763440580293,-0.035561526881160585,0,-0.017780763440580293,0,-0.035561526881160585,0,0,0,-0.017780763440580293,0,0,0,0,0.017780763440580293,0,0,0,0,-0.10668458064348176,0,-0.12446534408406204,0.035561526881160585,-0.07112305376232117,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017780763440580293,0,0,0.017780763440580293,0,0,-0.017780763440580293,0,0,0,-0.035561526881160585,0,-0.017780763440580293,0.16002687096522264,0,0,-0.07112305376232117,0.035561526881160585,0,0,0,0.017780763440580293,0,0.017780763440580293,-0.017780763440580293,0,-0.035561526881160585,0.017780763440580293,0,0,0,0.035561526881160585,-0.035561526881160585,0,0,0.05334229032174088,0,0.05334229032174088,0,0,-0.017780763440580293,0.07112305376232117,0,0.05334229032174088,-0.017780763440580293,0.07112305376232117,0,0.05334229032174088,-0.10668458064348176,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05334229032174088,-0.017780763440580293,0.035561526881160585,-0.05334229032174088,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017780763440580293,-0.035561526881160585,0.05334229032174088,-0.017780763440580293,0,-0.017780763440580293,0,-0.07112305376232117,0,-0.017780763440580293,0,0,0.017780763440580293,-0.017780763440580293,0.07112305376232117,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.035561526881160585,0,0,0,-0.017780763440580293,0.035561526881160585,0,0.017780763440580293,-0.05334229032174088,0,0,0,-0.05334229032174088,0.017780763440580293,0,0.017780763440580293,-0.017780763440580293,0.035561526881160585,0,0.017780763440580293,0,0,0,0,0,0.07112305376232117,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05334229032174088,0,0.07112305376232117,-0.017780763440580293,0.07112305376232117,0,0.16002687096522264,-0.035561526881160585,0.017780763440580293,0,0,0,0.05334229032174088,-0.017780763440580293,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08890381720290147,-0.017780763440580293,0,0,0.035561526881160585,-0.017780763440580293,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-40-1","text":"> However, I got the top first-class in obstetrics and gynaecology, and that was simply because you had to go and do this in residence, and at the time there was... you had to go into residence in a maternity hospital, and at the time of course all the students were trying to get into the white maternity hospital, Florence Nightingale, and be in the professor's firm to further their careers, and I didn't care where they sent me, and so I got a hospital right at the bottom of the list. > > It was a hospital in Durban, it was a black hospital and it was just on the Congella docks, and the four medical students who were all the kind of... you know, the leftovers, had this hotel room in this hotel where... let me just put it this way: amoebic dysentery was the mildest disease you could catch there.

I was interested in mitochondria and thought that the whole supravital staining of mitochondria was due to the oxidising enzymes there and the redox potential and so on. And so I synthesised a lot of dyes in the series... papers published, which differed... which were very similar, but differed in their redox potential and showed that only ones of these below a certain potential would be supravital stains, whereas all the others would be reduced and so bleached, and that's one of the things I did then. > > I also did another, which... which is an interesting experiment and which laid the basis for much of my later work, and it was a paper that showed that Claude's microsomal particles were the same as what the histologists were calling chromodial substance or ergastoplasm, which is they had to do with protein synthesis. > > Now I think what's interesting is the way I did this. Right, Claude had fractionated cells, these ribonucleic acid particles in an ultracentrifuge and had showed that they came to occupy a certain band in this, and they contained nucleic acid and they of course are the ribosomes as we now know them, the seat of protein synthesis. All the histologists had stained sections with dyes, of which the famous one was methyl-green pyronine, with a pyronine-stained chromodial substance or... or ergastoplasm, as it was called – red – and of course this... these were also supposed to be ribonucleic acid, but how could you tell if the particles were sub-microscopic – you couldn't see them. > > So what I did was: there were no ultracentrifuges, so I decided to use each cell as an ultracentrifuge and so I built a Beams and King air turbine ultracentrifuge, took pieces of liver, put them in this ultracentrifuge and spun them at this high velocity which I could get in an air driven turbine, and then cut sections of them so that each cell was like a little ultracentrifuge tube, and showed that the ergastoplasm sedimented in this cell to the same level that it did in a test-tube, above the glycogen, whatever. > > And there... I was very proud of that experiment... also led to something which I could write about later, the same experiment, which I published later, which was something called the Chromatic Nuclear Membrane, because I showed that there was chromatin that you couldn't spin off a nuclear membrane, which I believe is now coming back into fashion these days.

And I think that that – which is written there, at the time – just says what... what this influenced me, and I think it's been very important, at least in my approach, which is that **you've got to really find out**.","section":42,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.07602859212697055,0,0,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0,0,0.10137145616929406,0,0,0,0.025342864042323516,-0.07602859212697055,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12671432021161758,-0.025342864042323516,0,-0.07602859212697055,0,-0.025342864042323516,0,0,0.4815144168041468,0,0,0,0,-0.07602859212697055,0,0,0.1520571842539411,0,0.3548000965925292,0,0,0,0,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0.025342864042323516,0,0.05068572808464703,-0.025342864042323516,0,0,0.025342864042323516,-0.05068572808464703,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05068572808464703,0,0,0,0,0.07602859212697055,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05068572808464703,0.025342864042323516,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0,0,0.1774000482962646,-0.05068572808464703,0,0,0.05068572808464703,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.025342864042323516,-0.07602859212697055,0.025342864042323516,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0,-0.05068572808464703,0,-0.025342864042323516,0,0,0.025342864042323516,-0.07602859212697055,0,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0,-0.12671432021161758,0,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,0.025342864042323516,-0.025342864042323516,0,0,0.07602859212697055,0,0,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0.025342864042323516,-0.10137145616929406,0,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25342864042323515,0,0,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0.025342864042323516,-0.025342864042323516,0,-0.05068572808464703,0,0,0.05068572808464703,-0.025342864042323516,0.25342864042323515,-0.07602859212697055,0,0,0.05068572808464703,0,0,0,0.025342864042323516,-0.025342864042323516,0,0,0.10137145616929406,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0.025342864042323516,-0.025342864042323516,0,-0.05068572808464703,0,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0,-0.025342864042323516,0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0.025342864042323516,-0.10137145616929406,0,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,-0.10137145616929406,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0,-0.05068572808464703,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,0,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0.3294572325502057,0,0,-0.05068572808464703,0.025342864042323516,-0.1774000482962646,0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,0,0,0.05068572808464703,0,0,0,0,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0.05068572808464703,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.12671432021161758,0,0,0.07602859212697055,0,0,0,0.07602859212697055,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0,-0.05068572808464703,0,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0.025342864042323516,-0.025342864042323516,0,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0,0,0.07602859212697055,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,0,0,0.05068572808464703,0,0.05068572808464703,-0.025342864042323516,0.07602859212697055,-0.025342864042323516,0,0,0.22808577638091165,0,0,-0.025342864042323516,0,0,0.05068572808464703,0,0.025342864042323516,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025342864042323516]},{"id":"transcript-43-1","text":"> So during the course of my sort of dual career as a kind of reluctant medical student, together with being a practising scientist and I should say, also later on, a lecturer in physiology and a tutor all at the same time, I have come to the conclusion I've got to go abroad, and after the war, of course, many people did. > > I had already turned down this offer of Le Gros Clark but thought, this is really what I wanted to do, and in...

And at the same time the amino acid was joined to make this and it was very crude... idea, but in fact I had a mechanism – what was very hot at that time was actophosphate bonds, and high energy phosphate bonds, and this seemed to me to fit pretty well and I had these great ideas that this is how you make proteins and specify them.","section":44,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01859198597837567,-0.01859198597837567,0.03718397195675134,0,0,0,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0,0.1859198597837567,0,0.01859198597837567,-0.01859198597837567,0,-0.09295992989187835,0,-0.01859198597837567,0.07436794391350268,0,0.4833916354377674,-0.03718397195675134,0.01859198597837567,-0.01859198597837567,0,-0.05577595793512701,0,0,0.22310383174050805,0,0.4833916354377674,-0.03718397195675134,0,-0.03718397195675134,0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0.01859198597837567,-0.05577595793512701,0,0,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01859198597837567,0.01859198597837567,-0.01859198597837567,0.05577595793512701,-0.05577595793512701,0.03718397195675134,0,0,0,0.01859198597837567,-0.07436794391350268,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,0,0.01859198597837567,0,0.05577595793512701,0,0,0,0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0,0,0.01859198597837567,-0.01859198597837567,0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0.01859198597837567,0,0.03718397195675134,-0.01859198597837567,0,0,0.05577595793512701,0,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0,0.03718397195675134,-0.05577595793512701,0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.14873588782700536,0,0,0.01859198597837567,-0.03718397195675134,0,0,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,-0.03718397195675134,0.07436794391350268,0,0,-0.05577595793512701,0.07436794391350268,-0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01859198597837567,0,0,-0.01859198597837567,0.01859198597837567,0,0.16732787380538103,0,0,0,0.01859198597837567,-0.01859198597837567,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,-0.03718397195675134,0.09295992989187835,-0.01859198597837567,0.01859198597837567,0,0.1859198597837567,-0.05577595793512701,0,-0.03718397195675134,0,0,0,0,0.03718397195675134,-0.01859198597837567,0,-0.01859198597837567,0.01859198597837567,-0.03718397195675134,0,0,0,0,0.01859198597837567,0,0,-0.05577595793512701,0,0,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,0,0.03718397195675134,0,0.01859198597837567,-0.05577595793512701,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05577595793512701,-0.01859198597837567,0,-0.07436794391350268,0,-0.1301439018486297,0.01859198597837567,-0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0,0.2416958177188837,0,0,0,0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0.05577595793512701,-0.01859198597837567,0.03718397195675134,0,0.01859198597837567,-0.01859198597837567,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,-0.05577595793512701,0.07436794391350268,-0.03718397195675134,0,0,0,-0.03718397195675134,0,0,0.16732787380538103,0,0,0,0,-0.01859198597837567,0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0,0,0.03718397195675134,-0.07436794391350268,0.01859198597837567,-0.03718397195675134,0,0,0.01859198597837567,-0.03718397195675134,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,-0.03718397195675134,0.01859198597837567,-0.01859198597837567,0.05577595793512701,0,0,-0.05577595793512701,0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0,0,0.03718397195675134,0,0.03718397195675134,0,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,-0.07436794391350268,0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0.03718397195675134,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03718397195675134,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01859198597837567,0.01859198597837567,0,0.03718397195675134,0,0,0,0.03718397195675134,0,0.01859198597837567,0,0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0.07436794391350268,0,0.07436794391350268,0,0.2602878036972594,-0.03718397195675134,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01859198597837567,-0.07436794391350268,0,0,0.01859198597837567,0,0,-0.01859198597837567,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-45-1","text":"> What influenced me the most was the articles of von Neumann. Now, I had become interested in von Neumann not through the coding issues but through his interest in the nervous system and computers and of course, that's what Seymour was interested in because what we wanted to do is find out how the brain worked; that was what... you know, like a hobby on the side, you know. After... after dinner we'd work on central problems of the brain, you see, but it was trying to find out how this worked. > > And so I got this symposium, the Hixon Symposium, which I had got to read. I was, at that time, very fascinated by a rather strange complexion of psychology things by a man called Wolfgang Köhler who was a gestalt psychologist and another man called Lewin, who was what was called a topological psychologist and of course they were talking at a very different level, but in this book there is an article by Köhler and of course in that book there's this very famous paper which no one has ever read of von Neumann. > > Now of course later I discovered that those ideas were much older than the dating of this and that people had taken notes of them and they had circulated. But what is the brilliant part of this paper is in fact his description of what it takes to make a self-reproducing machine. And in fact if you look at what he says and what Schrödinger says, you can see what I have come to call **Schrödinger's fundamental error**, and in fact we can... I can find you the passage in that. > > But it's an amazing passage, because what von Neumann shows is that you have to have a mechanism not only of copying the machine but of copying the information that specifies the machine, right, so that he then divided the machine – the... the automaton as he called it – into three components: the functional part of the automaton; a... a decoding section of this which is part of that, which actually takes the tape, reads the instructions and builds the automaton; and a device that takes a copy of this tape and inserts it into the new automaton, right, which is the essential... essential, fundamental... > > And when von Neumann said that is the logical basis of self-reproduction, then you can see where Schrödinger made his mistake and this can be summarised in one sentence. **Schrödinger says the chromosomes contain the information to specify the future organism and the means to execute it and that's not true. The chromosomes contain the information to specify the future organisation and a description of the means to implement, but not the means themselves**, and that logical difference is made so crystal clear by von Neumann and that to me, was in fact... > > The first time now of course, I wasn't smart enough to really see that this is what DNA is all about, and of course it is one of the ironies of this entire field that were you to write a history of ideas in the whole of DNA, simply from the documented information as it exists in the literature, that is a kind of Hegelian history of ideas, you would certainly say that Watson and Crick depended on von Neumann, because von Neumann essentially tells you how it's done and then you just... DNA is just one of the implementations of this. But of course, none knew anything about the other, and so it's a... it's a great paradox to me that in fact this connection was not seen. > > Linus Pauling is present at that meeting because he gives this False Theory of Antibodies there. That means he heard von Neumann, must have known von Neumann, but he couldn't put that together with DNA and of course... well, neither could Linus Pauling put his own paper together with his future work because he and Delbrück wrote a paper on self... on self-complementation – two pieces of information – in about 1949 and had forgotten it by the time he did DNA, so that of course leads to a really distrust about what all the historians of science say, especially those of the history of ideas. > > But I think that that in a way is part of our kind of revolution in thinking, namely the whole of the theory of computation, which I think biologists have yet to assimilate and yet is there and it's a... it's an amazingly paradoxical field. You know, most fields start by struggling through from, from experimental confusion through early theoretical, you know, self-delusion, finally to the great generality and this field starts the other way round. It starts with a total abstract generality, namely it starts with, with Gödel's hypothesis or the Turing machine, and then it takes, you know, 50 years to descend into... into banality, you see.

He's saying that you could actually implement the organism because he goes on to add: \"But the term code script is of course too narrow. The chromosome structures are at the same time instrumental in bringing about the development they foreshadow. They are law code and executive power, or to use another simile they are architect's plan and builder's craft in one.\" > > What he is saying here is that the chromosomes not only contain a description of the future organism but the means to implement that description or program as we might call it. That's wrong, because they don't contain the means to implement it, they only contain a description of the means to implement it and that distinction was made absolutely crystal clear by this remarkable paper of von Neumann, in which he develops and in fact provides a proof of what a self-reproducing automaton – or machine – would have to... would have to contain in order to satisfy the requirements of self-reproduction. > > He develops this concept of course from the earlier concept of Turing, who had developed ideas of automata that operated on tapes and which of course gave a mechanical example of how you might implement some computation. And if you like, this is the beginning of the theory of computation and what von Neumann has to say about this is made very clear in this essay. > > And he says that you've got to have several components, and I'll just summarise them. He said you first start with an automaton A, \"which, when furnished this description of any other automaton in terms of the appropriate functions, will construct that entity\". It's like a Turing machine, you see. So automaton A has to be given a tape and then it'll make another automaton A, all right. > > Now what you have, you've got to have... add to this automaton B. \"Automaton B can make a copy of any instruction I that is furnished to it\", so if you give it a program, it'll copy the program. And then you have... you combine A and B with each other and you give a control mechanism C, that you have to add as well, which does the following. It says, \"Let A be furnished with the instruction I\".

When he was a physicist, he could go into a bath and he could lie there for three hours and he could think about physics, but he said when he went into biology, no sooner did he get in the bath then he'd have to get out and look up another fact.

I mean... which you know was going to become clear in the next 20 years. > > And so I started to work on bacteriophage and I started to read about them. Hinshelwood wanted me to work on resistance because he was a great believer in the time that bacteria adapted to certain situations and then what was inherited was in fact the adapted state and he didn't believe in mutation. Strictly speaking, he said that the evidence that people had didn't support the idea that there were mutants. That was his... his thing. > > Now, I think in modern language we will see that those ideas are pretty common today, like we don't call it inheritance, we can say the persistence of, or the descent of, a certain determined state, which is not because there's been a gene mutation, but because there's a self-perpetuating state. And of course, he came in, he was very... he was very controversial, and so I started to work on bacteriophage resistance in a physical chemistry lab which was totally unequipped to do any biological work. > > We had to... we were given a pressure cooker and thirty glass petri dishes and some pipettes and you had to make your own petri dishes and all the pipettes were Pasteur pipettes which you had to plug yourself, and sterilise in an oven.

Hinshelwoodian theories could easily explain lysogeny – that is, the switch between lysogenic and lytic – and what he was doing was trying to explain resistance. And I'll never forget... and I tried to explain it to him at the end, I said to him... I said, 'Professor, in science as in life, it is important to distinguish between chastity and impotence. The outcome is the same, the reasons are fundamentally different.' Okay. > > So... that I've used... this is a very important... it's a difference between can't and won't basically. So, mutation says you're bacteriophage resistant, because you lose a receptor to bind the bacteriophage; that is impotence, okay?

For example, I had to go and get phages, so I got them from across the road in the pathology department when I met some people there that were working on phage as phage... were working for Sir Paul Fildes, who was a member of the old school of microbiologists, you know; came every morning to the lab in a bowler hat and striped car... trousers and so on – a very nice man. One of the important people for antimetabolites, the whole background of, you know, sulphonamides and so on, and what that led to, and I got to know them, and I got to know some people there; I got to know people in the biochemistry department, because I had to learn about bacteria. > > I actually got to know people in the organic chemistry department because I had discovered that some phage mutants were also tryptophan deficient. That had been known, but I got one of these and I decided to go and find out why they were, so I started to work on tryptophan biosynthesis and I got a theory of what might be happening, if I had to go and make one of the intermediates. And so I went across to the Dyson Perrins Laboratory where I got hold of a bench and was doing there. > > One morning, Sir Robert Robertson... Robertson swept in and started to ask me what I was doing, got very interested in, and I couldn't explain to him that I was a... an intruder and apparently, about a week later, he came in and asked where this interesting person had gone, because I'd done my work and disappeared and so... but in fact, again, you see, that is very interesting because if you want to... I needed these intermediates; you couldn't get them anywhere, so the best thing is to go and make them. I mean, how do you make them, you get hold of a paper and it says, you know, take two teaspoonfuls of this compound and stir well in, so I did it, you see, and I made it, I crystallised it, but **this is something you can always do... it's open to you. There's no magic in this** and I think the whole of the philosophy that says unless you've gone through this way, if you're an old chap of 25, you can't do it. What you have to be is 18 and naive and go to a course and learn how to do it.

The second paper appeared a little later than that.","section":56,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0,0,0,-0.0213055500729938,0,0,0.0213055500729938,-0.0213055500729938,0.06391665021898141,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0852222002919752,0,0.0213055500729938,-0.0852222002919752,0,-0.0426111001459876,0.0213055500729938,0,0.0426111001459876,-0.0213055500729938,0.5752498519708327,0,0,-0.0426111001459876,0,-0.06391665021898141,0,0,0.106527750364969,0,0.426111001459876,0,0.0213055500729938,-0.06391665021898141,0,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,-0.0213055500729938,0,-0.0213055500729938,0,0,0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,-0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0,0.06391665021898141,0,0,-0.0426111001459876,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,0,0.12783330043796282,0,0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0213055500729938,0.0852222002919752,0,0,-0.06391665021898141,0.0213055500729938,0,0.0426111001459876,-0.06391665021898141,0.06391665021898141,0,0,-0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,-0.0426111001459876,0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,-0.0213055500729938,0,0,0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0213055500729938,0,-0.0213055500729938,0,-0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,-0.106527750364969,0,0,0.0213055500729938,0,0.0213055500729938,0,0.0213055500729938,-0.0213055500729938,0,0,0.0426111001459876,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0.1704444005839504,0,0.0213055500729938,0,0,-0.1704444005839504,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,0,0.12783330043796282,-0.0426111001459876,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0213055500729938,0,-0.106527750364969,0,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,0,0.06391665021898141,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,-0.0426111001459876,0,0,0.0213055500729938,0,0,-0.12783330043796282,0,-0.0426111001459876,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0426111001459876,0,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,0,0.3408888011679008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,-0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,0,0.0426111001459876,0,0.0426111001459876,0,0.0426111001459876,-0.0213055500729938,0.0852222002919752,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,-0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,-0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,-0.1491388505109566,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06391665021898141,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06391665021898141,0,0,-0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1491388505109566,0.0213055500729938,-0.0213055500729938,0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0,-0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0213055500729938,0,0,0.0852222002919752,-0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0426111001459876,0,0.0426111001459876,-0.0426111001459876,0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0.1704444005839504,-0.12783330043796282,0.0213055500729938,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0213055500729938,0,-0.0213055500729938,0.06391665021898141,0,0,0,0.0213055500729938,0]},{"id":"transcript-57-1","text":"> The first paper just defined the structure, and this... and had nothing to do about the explanation of mutation and replication and so on. And then there was a second paper which did that. The first paper just said, 'We have... invented a... the structure of the one', and it has this last sentence: **'It has not escaped our attention'**. And that is simply because that was published side by side with the Wilkins-Franklin thing, you see, so it was just the structure. And then they put in this caveat phrase, and then they wrote a second paper which, by the way, nobody actually seems to have digested. Everybody compresses both. The second paper is the one that shows... discusses replication, discusses the problem of the unwinding of the chains, discusses it as the mechanism of mutation, the tautomers and so on, and also raises all the questions of the code, you see. > > You see, most people at the time, if you read the literature and read everything around it, you will see that people said, 'Well, unwinding the chains looks impossible'. And so immediately of course that brings you into a domain where it says, 'Well, although there is some structural evidence for this, some theoretical constraints have to be applied'. Now, in my philosophy, the **Don't Worry hypothesis** says that all of... all of those can be relegated to the future. But there was a guy in molecular biology later, a man called Cavalieri, who refused to accept the double helix, and he proposed a model in which there were two chains side by side, and then they could separate without unwinding. And there was this incredible argument that I had, because he thought I would support him. I said, 'I believe in it and also I don't know how the problem is going to be solved, but I believe in the structure'. And that's the same thing about all of these structures. > > So the Don't Worry hypothesis which I formulated at the time was, 'There must be an enzyme that breaks the chain, and then unwinds them, and then joins them again'. Now I thought, 'Nobody could prove this; you couldn't write it down'. Later, such enzymes were found – they're called, amongst other things, helicases – and they do this. So if you had rejected this and said, 'Look, you know, the double helix doesn't work because you can't solve the problem', then you might as well have just rejected everything and said, 'Let's go and do something else'. And I think that's **very important in biology** because you will frequently come up against these objections where people say, 'Impossible, can't be done', and you say, 'Well, let's just work on it'.","section":57,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.08950240727420222,0,0.02983413575806741,0,0,0,0,-0.02983413575806741,0.02983413575806741,0,0,-0.014917067879033704,0,-0.02983413575806741,0,-0.014917067879033704,0.014917067879033704,0,0.04475120363710111,0,0.08950240727420222,0,0,-0.08950240727420222,0,-0.014917067879033704,0,0,0.7011021903145841,-0.04475120363710111,0,-0.014917067879033704,0,-0.014917067879033704,0.014917067879033704,0,0.08950240727420222,0,0.3878437648548763,0,0,-0.02983413575806741,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,0.014917067879033704,0,0.02983413575806741,0,0,-0.014917067879033704,0,-0.014917067879033704,0.014917067879033704,0,0.04475120363710111,0,0,-0.04475120363710111,0.02983413575806741,-0.014917067879033704,0,-0.02983413575806741,0,-0.02983413575806741,0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014917067879033704,0.05966827151613482,-0.014917067879033704,0,0,0.014917067879033704,0,0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,0.02983413575806741,-0.014917067879033704,0.05966827151613482,-0.04475120363710111,0.08950240727420222,0,0.02983413575806741,-0.02983413575806741,0.05966827151613482,-0.04475120363710111,0,0,0.02983413575806741,0,0.02983413575806741,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04475120363710111,0,-0.014917067879033704,0.02983413575806741,0,0.014917067879033704,-0.02983413575806741,0,0,0,0,0.04475120363710111,-0.05966827151613482,0,0,0,-0.04475120363710111,0,-0.13425361091130333,0,-0.02983413575806741,0,0,0,0,0.02983413575806741,-0.05966827151613482,0.014917067879033704,0,0.04475120363710111,-0.02983413575806741,0,-0.02983413575806741,0.014917067879033704,0,0,-0.014917067879033704,0,-0.014917067879033704,0.02983413575806741,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.10441947515323594,0,0.04475120363710111,0,0,-0.014917067879033704,0.014917067879033704,-0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,-0.02983413575806741,0.04475120363710111,0,0.20883895030647187,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,0,-0.07458533939516852,0,0,0.014917067879033704,0,0.04475120363710111,-0.04475120363710111,0.08950240727420222,0,0,0,0,0,0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,0.04475120363710111,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014917067879033704,0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,0.014917067879033704,-0.05966827151613482,0,-0.11933654303226963,0.014917067879033704,-0.07458533939516852,0,0,0,-0.014917067879033704,0,-0.05966827151613482,0,0,0,-0.05966827151613482,0,0,0,0,0.014917067879033704,-0.014917067879033704,0.04475120363710111,-0.02983413575806741,0.08950240727420222,0,0.014917067879033704,0,0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,0.014917067879033704,-0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,-0.07458533939516852,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02983413575806741,0,0.02983413575806741,-0.014917067879033704,0.014917067879033704,-0.014917067879033704,0,-0.02983413575806741,0.04475120363710111,0,0.13425361091130333,-0.014917067879033704,0,-0.014917067879033704,0,-0.05966827151613482,0,0,0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,0.07458533939516852,-0.014917067879033704,0,0,0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,0.014917067879033704,-0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,0.02983413575806741,0,0,-0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05966827151613482,0,0.05966827151613482,0,0,0,0,-0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,0,0.02983413575806741,0,0.04475120363710111,0,0,-0.014917067879033704,0,0,0.07458533939516852,0,0,0,0,-0.014917067879033704,0,0,0.07458533939516852,0,0.014917067879033704,-0.02983413575806741,0.04475120363710111,0,0.02983413575806741,0,0.17900481454840445,-0.014917067879033704,0,-0.014917067879033704,0,0,0.04475120363710111,0,0,-0.014917067879033704,0,0,0,0,0.10441947515323594,-0.02983413575806741,0,0,0,0,0.014917067879033704,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-58-1","text":"> But that's also the first time when I saw that...

And as the forerunner of the interpreter of the helical diffraction.","section":60,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.018676098402828818,0,0.018676098402828818,0,0,-0.056028295208486456,0.056028295208486456,-0.018676098402828818,0.018676098402828818,0,0.018676098402828818,0,0.018676098402828818,-0.11205659041697291,0,-0.07470439361131527,0,-0.018676098402828818,0.1307326888198017,0,0.11205659041697291,0,0,-0.1307326888198017,0,0,0.037352196805657635,-0.037352196805657635,0.5976351488905222,0,0,-0.07470439361131527,0,-0.037352196805657635,0,0,0.22411318083394582,0,0.3174936728480899,0,0,-0.07470439361131527,0,0,0,-0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,0,0,-0.056028295208486456,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018676098402828818,-0.037352196805657635,0,-0.018676098402828818,0.07470439361131527,-0.018676098402828818,0,-0.037352196805657635,0,0,0.018676098402828818,-0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,-0.14940878722263054,0,-0.037352196805657635,0,0,0,0,0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,0,0,0.037352196805657635,0,0,-0.018676098402828818,0,-0.018676098402828818,0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,0.018676098402828818,0,0.037352196805657635,-0.018676098402828818,0,0,0.07470439361131527,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.056028295208486456,0,0,-0.037352196805657635,0,-0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,0,0,-0.14940878722263054,0,0,0,0,0.018676098402828818,-0.07470439361131527,0,-0.018676098402828818,0.018676098402828818,-0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,-0.056028295208486456,0,-0.018676098402828818,0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,0.037352196805657635,0,0,-0.037352196805657635,0,0,0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,0.07470439361131527,0,0,-0.018676098402828818,0.09338049201414408,0,0,0,0,-0.037352196805657635,0,0,0,-0.037352196805657635,0,0,0.09338049201414408,0,0.18676098402828817,0,0,-0.018676098402828818,0.037352196805657635,0,0,0,0.1307326888198017,-0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018676098402828818,0,0,0.037352196805657635,0,0.18676098402828817,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.09338049201414408,0,0,0,0,0,-0.037352196805657635,0,-0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,-0.037352196805657635,0,0,0,-0.056028295208486456,0,-0.018676098402828818,0.018676098402828818,-0.056028295208486456,0,0,0.018676098402828818,0,0.018676098402828818,-0.037352196805657635,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018676098402828818,0,0.018676098402828818,0,0.16808488562545937,0,0,-0.037352196805657635,0,0,0,-0.018676098402828818,0,0,0.037352196805657635,0,0.018676098402828818,-0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,0,0.018676098402828818,-0.056028295208486456,0,0,0.018676098402828818,0,0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,0,-0.018676098402828818,0.09338049201414408,0,0.018676098402828818,0,0,-0.018676098402828818,0.018676098402828818,-0.018676098402828818,0,-0.037352196805657635,0,0,0.09338049201414408,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,0,0,-0.16808488562545937,0,0,0,-0.018676098402828818,0.018676098402828818,-0.07470439361131527,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.037352196805657635,0,0,-0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,-0.018676098402828818,0,-0.037352196805657635,0,0,0,-0.056028295208486456,0.018676098402828818,0,0,-0.018676098402828818,0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018676098402828818,0,0.018676098402828818,0,0.037352196805657635,-0.018676098402828818,0,0,0.09338049201414408,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018676098402828818,0,0.037352196805657635,-0.018676098402828818,0.037352196805657635,0,0,0,0.205437082431117,-0.056028295208486456,0,-0.037352196805657635,0,0,0.11205659041697291,0,0,0,0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,0,-0.037352196805657635,0,0,0.018676098402828818,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-61-1","text":"> The model wasn't accepted at all.

At the turn of the century, when genetics had become an established science, many people went into genetics because the problems they were working with were insoluble. And the most important one is TH Morgan. TH Morgan started life as an embryologist, and which he found intractable. And he has written in his book *Regeneration* that in fact... he turned to genetics because this would give him a new entry into development. > > And most of the early geneticists did that. To try to find genes and the mechanisms of these... of this. By the beginning of the war – that is after the first biochemical genetics in drosophila had been done, that is the eye colour – it had become clear that it... it was extremely difficult to get any deeper than just finding a mutant and finding out what it does. That is the purely descriptive level. > > And that is why when people started to work with neurospora, Beadle and Tatum started to do biochemical genetics, this immediately attracted people like Ephrussi and attracted people Jacques Monod into this, and of course by 1945 we had this idea that what genes do is control biochemical processes. And there it got stuck, and organismal genetics up to that time, beyond that time, had gone in the direction of population genetics. > > So it is the fusion of biochemistry and genetics that I think represented another thing which was completely absent at the time and that you could actually think of experiments which were designed to test the hypothesis. You could say, 'If this controls this enzyme, then it follows that if I get such and such a mutant the following would happen'. And that was such a remarkably interesting thing to be able to do in biology. > > And of course working with bacteriophage was very interesting, because I remember someone asked me, 'What statistical test do you use for significance?' You see, because normally in biochemistry you would do a subject by estimating the amount of calcium in the blood of an animal under different experimental conditions, then you do statistics to see if the differences were significant. And so I remember I said to him, **'We don't do any statistics... oh, I'm sorry, we do have one test. We plot our results on seven-cycle log paper – that is it goes over 10^7 – and you hold the sheet at one end of the room, and you stand at the other end of the room, and if you can see a difference it's significant'**.","section":62,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,0,-0.031567581587358555,0,-0.015783790793679277,0.06313516317471711,0,0.015783790793679277,-0.015783790793679277,0,-0.031567581587358555,0.015783790793679277,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0.11048653555575494,0,0.18940548952415132,-0.015783790793679277,0,-0.031567581587358555,0.015783790793679277,-0.031567581587358555,0.031567581587358555,-0.015783790793679277,0.568216468572454,0,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,-0.015783790793679277,0.031567581587358555,0,0.2051892803178306,-0.015783790793679277,0.39459476984198194,0,0.015783790793679277,-0.031567581587358555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04735137238103783,0,0,0,-0.031567581587358555,0.015783790793679277,-0.04735137238103783,0.015783790793679277,-0.04735137238103783,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0.015783790793679277,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,0,-0.06313516317471711,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,-0.015783790793679277,0.015783790793679277,0,0.04735137238103783,0,0,-0.04735137238103783,0.04735137238103783,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0,-0.04735137238103783,0,0,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,-0.031567581587358555,0,0,0,0,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,-0.11048653555575494,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0.04735137238103783,-0.015783790793679277,0.04735137238103783,-0.031567581587358555,0,-0.015783790793679277,0.015783790793679277,-0.07891895396839639,0.015783790793679277,-0.11048653555575494,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0.12627032634943422,0,0,0,0.031567581587358555,-0.09470274476207566,0,-0.031567581587358555,0.015783790793679277,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,0,0.29989202507990625,-0.031567581587358555,0,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,0,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0.031567581587358555,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,-0.015783790793679277,0.031567581587358555,0,0.04735137238103783,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,0,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,-0.031567581587358555,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,-0.06313516317471711,0,-0.015783790793679277,0.04735137238103783,-0.04735137238103783,0,0,0,0,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0.031567581587358555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.031567581587358555,0.07891895396839639,0,0,-0.07891895396839639,0,0,0,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0,-0.031567581587358555,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,0,0.06313516317471711,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,0,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0.15783790793679278,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,-0.12627032634943422,0,0,0.015783790793679277,-0.031567581587358555,0.031567581587358555,0,0.031567581587358555,0,0.06313516317471711,0,0.031567581587358555,0,0.031567581587358555,-0.031567581587358555,0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,0,-0.06313516317471711,0.031567581587358555,0,0,0,0.015783790793679277,-0.06313516317471711,0.015783790793679277,0,0.04735137238103783,0,0,0,0.06313516317471711,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.031567581587358555,0.031567581587358555,0,0.015783790793679277,-0.015783790793679277,0.015783790793679277,-0.15783790793679278,0,0,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,-0.031567581587358555,0,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0,0,0,-0.031567581587358555,0,0,0.04735137238103783,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0,-0.031567581587358555,0,-0.015783790793679277,0.015783790793679277,0,0.07891895396839639,-0.015783790793679277,0.06313516317471711,0,0,0,0.2683244434925477,-0.04735137238103783,0.015783790793679277,0,0.015783790793679277,0,0.06313516317471711,0,0,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0.015783790793679277,-0.015783790793679277,0.031567581587358555,-0.015783790793679277,0,0,0.06313516317471711,0,0,0,0.015783790793679277,0]},{"id":"transcript-62-2","text":"*[Q] Sorry Sydney, why... why did you not do statistics?

And someone else will pick up something from it. And I think the people who will not say anything until they've got it fully worked out, and there are people like this, these are people who don't have what I consider to be the most important thrill about doing... science is the kind of social interaction, the kind of companionship that comes from two people's minds playing on each other.

It's very important; this is not... this is not done. You know, and you can tell by the drawings. For example, you know, very early on we realised that the amount of DNA in a bacterium is 1mm long. And it's in a bacterium that's 1μ. So the DNA has been folded up a thousand times. And the pictures that you see of a bacterium with a little circle in it are ridiculous. > > Furthermore, when you think that most of the bacterium is full of these ribosomes and that the correct picture is not that ribosomes move along the messenger, but the messengers, because the ribosomes are big... their diffusion is quite slow. But the messengers must be moving through the cell like a lot of... like a lot of hysterical snakes, threading their way through the ribosomes like this. > > And... and I've always thought of it as very good to try to get that picture over.

This was the so-called Diamond Code and... and it became clear that the standard problems of the code then were that there were 64 triplets, 20 amino acids, and so one had to do something to arrange these triplets in this form and Gamow provided one explanation. > > He thought basically that overlapping triplets... that is triplets overlapping by two would determine the code and he put it in... in a form which looked physical in the sense that he thought there were diamond shaped cavities on DNA which covered three bases and thought that the amino acids would fit into this and he showed there was a way of arranging these... these three bases, such there were 20 groups of them, and since this 20 came out to be the same as the number of amino acids, the natural amino acids, one thought **the magic number had been reached**, and that was the thing.","section":68,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.02702702702702703,-0.05405405405405406,0,0,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0,-0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,-0.05405405405405406,0.02702702702702703,0,0.10810810810810811,0,0.08108108108108109,0,0,-0.05405405405405406,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0.3783783783783784,0,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,-0.05405405405405406,0,-0.05405405405405406,0.13513513513513514,0,0.40540540540540543,-0.05405405405405406,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05405405405405406,0.05405405405405406,0,0,0,0.05405405405405406,0,0,0,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0.10810810810810811,-0.05405405405405406,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05405405405405406,0.02702702702702703,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0.05405405405405406,0,0.02702702702702703,0,0.1891891891891892,0,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0,-0.05405405405405406,0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0.13513513513513514,0,0.08108108108108109,-0.05405405405405406,0,0,0.05405405405405406,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.10810810810810811,0,0,0.10810810810810811,-0.02702702702702703,0.16216216216216217,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.16216216216216217,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05405405405405406,0.05405405405405406,0,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0.05405405405405406,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.16216216216216217,0,0,0,0.02702702702702703,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0.3783783783783784,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0,-0.08108108108108109,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08108108108108109,-0.10810810810810811,0,-0.05405405405405406,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0,0.05405405405405406,0,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.13513513513513514,0.02702702702702703,-0.02702702702702703,0.10810810810810811,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,-0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0.1891891891891892,0,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,-0.08108108108108109,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08108108108108109,-0.05405405405405406,0,0,0.05405405405405406,0,0,-0.05405405405405406,0.08108108108108109,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,-0.08108108108108109,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,-0.13513513513513514,0.05405405405405406,0,0.05405405405405406,0,0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02702702702702703,0,0,-0.05405405405405406,0,0,0,0,0.02702702702702703,0,0.10810810810810811,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0,-0.05405405405405406,0,0,0.10810810810810811,0,0,0,0,-0.05405405405405406,0,0,0,0,0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05405405405405406,0,0.02702702702702703,0,0,-0.02702702702702703,0.21621621621621623,0,0.02702702702702703,-0.02702702702702703,0.05405405405405406,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0,0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0.08108108108108109,-0.05405405405405406,0,-0.02702702702702703,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-69-1","text":"> So what this did was formulate the questions of the code for the first time in a really serious manner.

There was a tremendous storm and at the outskirts of Albany, Jim said, 'You drive'. Now, I'd never driven on the right hand side of the road. This was an absolute storm – lightning. I don't know how... where I was going. Never driven in America before. Somehow I drove through Albany without killing us, and finally we got to the other side and stayed the night in a motel and... with the two of us, and then the next day we drove to Chicago where I stayed a few days with Jim at his family home and met his family there. > > And then from there we went on to Urbana, where we stopped there for an afternoon – that's where I met Luria, Ed Lennox and all the people who were at Urbana – and then from Urbana we drove out west, stopping at various places. I can remember stopping in Colorado Springs after a day in which we'd been stopped by a traffic policeman in a small town in Kansas where they had a speed limit... a ridiculous speed limit like 25ft an hour. And I noticed this policeman tailing us and I said... I was driving, and I said to Jim, 'What do... what do we do?' So he says, 'Just drive', you know, so I drove extremely carefully, and just as we came to the border, the Colorado/Kansas border, this policeman stopped us. And he said, 'You went through a traffic light. Get out of the car... go through a traffic light.' I said, 'Well, I don't... I don't think I did, but if I did I'm terribly sorry', you see. > > However, it was very clear that he was trying to get us – this was a Friday, I remember – and Jim kept on saying, 'Don't argue with him, because he'll put us in jail and there'll be no judge till Monday, and we'll have to spend the weekend in jail'. So he asked to see my driver's licence. I showed him a South African driver's licence. He says, 'I see, you're out of state'. So I said, 'Yes'. So he then said to Jim, 'Are you the car owner?' 'Yes.' And then he went to look, and in California at that time the licence was wrapped around the steering wheel. And of course he read it and he said, 'Are you Mr Dewey?' Because Jim's middle name is Dewey – JD Watson. He was called after... by... his father had a great admiration for the philosopher Dewey at Chicago, and was called James Dewey Watson. He didn't like the name, and of course he didn't like the policeman calling him Mr Dewey. And I could see Jim getting very, very het up, and so I kept on saying to him, 'Don't talk back to him or we'll be in jail for the weekend'. > > However, we went to Colorado. I drove; I think a remarkable thing that... that made such an impression on me. I mean, having travelled a lot in South Africa, deserts and mountains, I mean, this was just fabulous, the scenery in the Rockies, and the desert scenery there... thereafter was so fascinating.","section":76,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.03113618391226704,0,0,0,0,0,0.01556809195613352,0,0.09340855173680113,-0.01556809195613352,0.03113618391226704,0,0.01556809195613352,-0.03113618391226704,0.0778404597806676,-0.01556809195613352,0,0,0.03113618391226704,0,0.0778404597806676,0,0,-0.10897664369293464,0.01556809195613352,0,0,0,0.46704275868400563,-0.01556809195613352,0,0,0.01556809195613352,-0.04670427586840056,0.01556809195613352,0,0.23352137934200282,-0.06227236782453408,0.43590657477173855,-0.01556809195613352,0,-0.03113618391226704,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03113618391226704,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.09340855173680113,0,0,0,0,0.03113618391226704,0,0,-0.01556809195613352,0,0,0,-0.01556809195613352,0.06227236782453408,-0.01556809195613352,0,-0.06227236782453408,0,-0.01556809195613352,0.03113618391226704,-0.01556809195613352,0.0778404597806676,0,0.0778404597806676,0,0,0,0.01556809195613352,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0778404597806676,0.01556809195613352,-0.01556809195613352,0.03113618391226704,-0.01556809195613352,0.01556809195613352,-0.03113618391226704,0.01556809195613352,-0.01556809195613352,0,0,0.06227236782453408,0,0.01556809195613352,0,0,-0.01556809195613352,0,0,0.01556809195613352,0,0.03113618391226704,0,0,0,0,-0.01556809195613352,0,-0.04670427586840056,0,0,0,-0.01556809195613352,0.01556809195613352,-0.04670427586840056,0,0,0.03113618391226704,-0.0778404597806676,0,0,0.01556809195613352,-0.01556809195613352,0,0,0.01556809195613352,-0.06227236782453408,0,-0.01556809195613352,0.03113618391226704,0,0.01556809195613352,-0.01556809195613352,0.04670427586840056,-0.01556809195613352,0,-0.01556809195613352,0.01556809195613352,0,0.04670427586840056,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03113618391226704,0.18681710347360225,0,0,-0.03113618391226704,0,-0.0778404597806676,0,-0.0778404597806676,0,-0.01556809195613352,0,-0.01556809195613352,0.04670427586840056,0,0.09340855173680113,-0.01556809195613352,0.01556809195613352,-0.03113618391226704,0,0,0,-0.01556809195613352,0.0778404597806676,-0.06227236782453408,0.04670427586840056,0,0,0,0,0,0.01556809195613352,0,0.03113618391226704,0,0.09340855173680113,0,0.01556809195613352,0,0,-0.01556809195613352,0.04670427586840056,-0.01556809195613352,0.01556809195613352,0,0.01556809195613352,-0.04670427586840056,0,-0.03113618391226704,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03113618391226704,0,0,0,-0.03113618391226704,0,-0.09340855173680113,0.01556809195613352,-0.09340855173680113,0,-0.01556809195613352,0,-0.01556809195613352,0,-0.01556809195613352,0.04670427586840056,0,0,-0.03113618391226704,0,-0.03113618391226704,0,0,0.01556809195613352,0,0,0,0.18681710347360225,0,0,-0.03113618391226704,0.03113618391226704,0,0,0,0.09340855173680113,0,0,0,0.03113618391226704,-0.04670427586840056,0,0,0,-0.01556809195613352,0,0,0.01556809195613352,0,0,0,0,0,0.01556809195613352,-0.03113618391226704,0.0778404597806676,-0.01556809195613352,0.06227236782453408,-0.01556809195613352,0,0,0,-0.01556809195613352,0,-0.01556809195613352,0,0,0,-0.01556809195613352,0.12454473564906816,0,0,0,0.01556809195613352,0,0.01556809195613352,0,0,0,0,0,0.01556809195613352,-0.26465756325426987,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03113618391226704,0,-0.0778404597806676,0,0,0,-0.01556809195613352,0.20238519542973576,-0.04670427586840056,0.06227236782453408,-0.01556809195613352,0,0,0.01556809195613352,0,0.03113618391226704,0,0,0,0,-0.12454473564906816,0.01556809195613352,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01556809195613352,0,0,0,-0.04670427586840056,0.01556809195613352,0,0,0,0.03113618391226704,-0.0778404597806676,0,0,0.12454473564906816,-0.12454473564906816,0.01556809195613352,0,0,0,0,-0.03113618391226704,0,0,0.06227236782453408,0,0.01556809195613352,-0.01556809195613352,0,0,0.1401128276052017,-0.04670427586840056,0,-0.01556809195613352,0,-0.01556809195613352,0.01556809195613352,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12454473564906816,-0.01556809195613352,0,-0.01556809195613352,0.01556809195613352,0,0.01556809195613352,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-77-1","text":"> We then went through Monument Valley, which is where the four states meet, which is a desert, and it was hilarious because Jim said, 'You know, you can't get anything for 200 miles', or whatever it was, and he was... and, you know, he gave me pictures of disappearing there only, you know, to discover our bleached bones in the desert. > > And so while he... we went to a general store and while Jim was writing postcards to all his friends, you know, in Harvard saying, 'Farewell, we're about to embark on the desert', I who had travelled in deserts, you know, was getting equipped.

Gamow founded the RNA Tie Club, which was a club of people that were interested in coding. Everybody there was... were friends of Gamow, and so the... the club had 20 members, **each who had a name of an amino acid**. Needless to say, Gamow was alanine. And Francis, Leslie Orgel and myself were the last three. Francis was... Francis was tryptophan, Leslie Orgel was tyrosine, and I was valine, the last one. Of course alphabetical order there. And all the rest were friends of Gamow, so Nick Metropolis was a member of the Tie Club. Why? Because Nick Metropolis worked at Los Alamos on computers, and he was a friend of Gamow and they were going to crack the code with computers. > > The... the club had four honorary members, who were called by the bases. It had a... it had a Chief Optimist, that was Jim; a Chief Pessimist, that was Francis; these were the offices – it was a typical Gamow thing. He put it together, and I still have letters from him written on the notepaper of the 20th Century Limited. > > The remarkable story told about Gamow... Gamow had a job in Washington but was a consultant to Los Alamos, so travelled west very frequently and one day landed up in Chicago, which is where the trains... you had to change trains, and he ran out of money. And he went into this hotel and he started to... and he wanted to change a cheque; he had no money. But his cheque was on a bank in Woods Hole, the Falmouth Bank, and so he then produced – he then told him he was a professor in Washington, he produced his Los Alamos security card as identification – a... a bank in Falmouth, Massachusetts. So the young man there was looking very suspiciously at this character and what he was looking at was Gamow's tie pin. Because each member of the RNA Tie Club had a tie and a tie pin on which was printed his name. So he was looking at this thing called Alanine. So Gamow said to him... you know, he's saying, 'My name is Gamow', and so on. 'Oh,' he says, 'I see you looking at my tie pin'. He says, 'It's... it's Alanine there'. He says, 'I'll have to explain it to you'. He says... 'Tell me,' he says, **'how much do you know about the structure of DNA?'** > > So when I say it's a fringe thing, I mean, it certainly did not include people trying to change... to change cheques. But it was a fringe thing and it was a thing in which people seriously doubted. I can tell you without saying who was involved, but as 1958... the whole of DNA was still thought to be a flash in the pan, not right, you know, not known, not proven. And to actually believe in this in 1955 and actually start to do experiments on it, this was something that was just implausible. Because it was neither genetics, nor was it biochemistry.","section":79,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.01332267944962386,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09325875614736702,-0.01332267944962386,0.01332267944962386,0,0,-0.02664535889924772,0,-0.05329071779849544,0,0,0.1332267944962386,-0.01332267944962386,0.05329071779849544,0,0.01332267944962386,-0.14654947394586246,0.01332267944962386,-0.02664535889924772,0,0,0.45297110128721124,0,0,-0.05329071779849544,0,-0.03996803834887158,0,0,0.21316287119398175,-0.02664535889924772,0.30642162734134876,0,0.03996803834887158,0,0,0,0,-0.02664535889924772,0,0,0,-0.02664535889924772,0.02664535889924772,-0.01332267944962386,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01332267944962386,0,-0.01332267944962386,0,0,0.10658143559699088,0,0.05329071779849544,0,0,-0.02664535889924772,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01332267944962386,0,0,0.01332267944962386,0,0.07993607669774316,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02664535889924772,0,0,0,-0.01332267944962386,0,-0.01332267944962386,0.01332267944962386,-0.02664535889924772,0,-0.01332267944962386,0.05329071779849544,-0.01332267944962386,0,0,0.01332267944962386,0,0,0,0,0,0.02664535889924772,0,0.02664535889924772,-0.02664535889924772,0,-0.02664535889924772,0.02664535889924772,-0.01332267944962386,0.05329071779849544,0,0.01332267944962386,-0.01332267944962386,0,0,0,-0.03996803834887158,0,-0.01332267944962386,0,-0.01332267944962386,0,-0.11990411504661473,0,0,0.01332267944962386,0,0,0,0,-0.02664535889924772,0,0,0.0666133972481193,-0.01332267944962386,0,-0.0666133972481193,0.02664535889924772,-0.02664535889924772,0.02664535889924772,-0.02664535889924772,0,0,0.01332267944962386,0,0.01332267944962386,0,0.01332267944962386,0,0,0,0.15987215339548633,0,0.01332267944962386,0,0.02664535889924772,-0.02664535889924772,0,-0.01332267944962386,0,-0.01332267944962386,0.01332267944962386,0,0.03996803834887158,0,0.21316287119398175,-0.01332267944962386,0.02664535889924772,0,0,0,0,0,0.01332267944962386,0,0,-0.01332267944962386,0,0,0,0,0.01332267944962386,0,0.02664535889924772,0,0.05329071779849544,0,0.02664535889924772,-0.02664535889924772,0,0,0,0,0.02664535889924772,0,0,-0.03996803834887158,0,-0.05329071779849544,0,-0.02664535889924772,0,-0.05329071779849544,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01332267944962386,0,-0.0666133972481193,0.02664535889924772,-0.0666133972481193,0,-0.02664535889924772,0,-0.02664535889924772,0.01332267944962386,-0.01332267944962386,0,-0.02664535889924772,0.05329071779849544,0,0,-0.0666133972481193,0.01332267944962386,0,0.01332267944962386,0,0.01332267944962386,-0.01332267944962386,0.01332267944962386,0,0.3730350245894681,0,0,-0.01332267944962386,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01332267944962386,0,0.01332267944962386,-0.03996803834887158,0,-0.10658143559699088,0,0,0,0,0.01332267944962386,-0.01332267944962386,0.01332267944962386,0,0.05329071779849544,0,0.01332267944962386,-0.11990411504661473,0,0,0.21316287119398175,0,0.01332267944962386,0,0.05329071779849544,-0.03996803834887158,0,-0.03996803834887158,0,-0.01332267944962386,0,0,0.02664535889924772,-0.01332267944962386,0.01332267944962386,0,0.01332267944962386,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03996803834887158,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05329071779849544,0,0,0.01332267944962386,0,0,0,0.25313090954285333,0,0,0,0,-0.01332267944962386,0,-0.0666133972481193,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03996803834887158,0.01332267944962386,-0.01332267944962386,0.18651751229473404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01332267944962386,-0.01332267944962386,0.01332267944962386,0,0.01332267944962386,-0.03996803834887158,0,0,0.03996803834887158,0,0.02664535889924772,0,0,0,0,0,0.02664535889924772,0,0.01332267944962386,-0.01332267944962386,0,-0.01332267944962386,0,-0.01332267944962386,0.22648555064360562,-0.0666133972481193,0,-0.05329071779849544,0,0,0.09325875614736702,0,0.01332267944962386,0,0,0,0.03996803834887158,0,0.02664535889924772,-0.01332267944962386,0,-0.01332267944962386,0.07993607669774316,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-80-1","text":"> We came to Cal Tech, and that again brought me in direct contact with the Phage Group – the Phage Church – at which I met many people there that had become... you know, had become... had become lifelong friends.

By this time I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I had formulated what had be... what we had come... was **the gene protein problem**. That is, we would investigate the correlation between genes and proteins by getting a gene on which we could do fine structure analysis, and then its corresponding protein on which we could do chemical sequencing. And the first question was to prove co-linearity. Namely that the mutations occurred in the gene in the same order with which they were present in the proteins. > > Now, of course that was inspired by work that had been done by Vernon Ingram, who actually showed that sickle cell haemoglobin, which Pauling had showed involved a chemical change, Vernon showed was a singular change, the conversion of one glutamic to a lysine, within one place in the haemoglobin. And he'd invented a fingerprinting method to show this. And so we were going to fuse these two technologies in order to start to investigate the relation between genes and proteins. And of course at that stage everything was enormously difficult to do. And you had to get large amounts of protein to do this. Haemoglobin... you can get grams of haemoglobin. > > And so we had... and what had happened then... I'm still travelling. I'm still travelling back with pieces of paper and I'm just filling in the background. And on the... and so one of the thoughts was the program that had been developed was that we would have to do, we would either have to find the protein of the rII gene, which actually never succeeded, or we would have to find another gene which... which did a phage and which... which specified something in the virus and on which we could do fine structure. And one of these genes was the host range, which George Streisinger was working on, and another of these genes was something in which... had been worked on and for which there was evidence, and it was cofactor requirement of bacteriophages. There were some bacteriophages that were not absorbed unless tryptophan was present. And so there were natural variations of this and I thought I could get mutants of these. That is something that Delbrück himself worked on, from the kinetic point of view.","section":81,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.017394592861488423,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0.17394592861488423,0,0.24352430006083792,0,0.034789185722976845,-0.10436755716893054,0,-0.06957837144595369,0,0,0.4000756358142337,0,0,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0.034789185722976845,-0.034789185722976845,0.26091889292232634,0,0.3826810429527453,-0.017394592861488423,0,-0.017394592861488423,0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.034789185722976845,0.05218377858446527,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0.017394592861488423,-0.034789185722976845,0,0,0.05218377858446527,0,0.017394592861488423,-0.017394592861488423,0.017394592861488423,0,0,-0.034789185722976845,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0,-0.034789185722976845,0,0,0.20873511433786107,0,0,0,0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017394592861488423,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0.017394592861488423,-0.017394592861488423,0.2261297071993495,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08697296430744211,0.08697296430744211,0,0.017394592861488423,-0.017394592861488423,0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0,-0.05218377858446527,0,0,0,0,0.06957837144595369,-0.06957837144595369,0,0,0.017394592861488423,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0.05218377858446527,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0.017394592861488423,0,0.017394592861488423,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0.17394592861488423,0,0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0.017394592861488423,0,0,-0.034789185722976845,0.017394592861488423,-0.05218377858446527,0,0,0.27831348578381476,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05218377858446527,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0,0.06957837144595369,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0,0,0.017394592861488423,-0.034789185722976845,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05218377858446527,0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0.017394592861488423,-0.06957837144595369,0,-0.017394592861488423,0,-0.034789185722976845,0,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0,-0.017394592861488423,0.017394592861488423,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0.034789185722976845,-0.034789185722976845,0,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0.24352430006083792,0,0,-0.034789185722976845,0,0,0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0.017394592861488423,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0,-0.034789185722976845,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06957837144595369,-0.05218377858446527,0.017394592861488423,0,0.017394592861488423,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0.017394592861488423,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0,-0.034789185722976845,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017394592861488423,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.17394592861488423,0,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,-0.06957837144595369,0.017394592861488423,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0,0,0.017394592861488423,-0.034789185722976845,0,0,0.017394592861488423,0,0,-0.08697296430744211,0,-0.017394592861488423,0.034789185722976845,0,0.017394592861488423,0,0,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0,0,0.05218377858446527,-0.017394592861488423,0.034789185722976845,0,0,0,0.034789185722976845,0,0,0,0.06957837144595369,-0.017394592861488423,0.034789185722976845,0,0,0,0.2957080786453032,-0.034789185722976845,0.017394592861488423,-0.05218377858446527,0,-0.05218377858446527,0.017394592861488423,-0.034789185722976845,0,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0,0.05218377858446527,-0.017394592861488423,0,0,0,0,0.034789185722976845,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-82-1","text":"> So I returned to South Africa in December of that year – it's '54 – with the idea that I would start to work on the genetics of cofactor requirement in order to prepare the way for a full gene protein analysis, and that is something that I could do in South Africa.

I had plenty of space there. And I got a grant from the South African cancer thing to do cofactor, Phage Cofactor Genetics. And I actually did all of that there. I had very little equipment; I had a very nice girl that I could hire. Betty van Zyl, she was a Cape coloured girl, and I taught her how to pour petri dishes, and we had to do everything with quite primitive thing. But I'm very proud of that, because I actually did that paper. I actually did get recombinants for cofactor mutants, I developed methods of doing it, and I published it, and I was very proud because when I sent the manuscript to Max Delbrück, before I published it, he actually... he called together a seminar to discuss this important work. And of course this is what I took back to Cambridge. > > So I mean, to sit there... and I continued to work on my coding theory, and in fact by a... by 1950, early '54... by late '54, I had enough information, and I'd thought of a trick to actually prove that all overlapping triplet codes were impossible. And in fact that appeared the... I wrote an RNA Tie Club thing from South Africa that was circulated, and then Gamow was very... thought it very important, and it got published in PNAS. He submitted that paper. So that was my theoretical paper. That was... I think, if I remember, it was in '55. And that of course... it was entitled **'On the Impossibility of All Overlapping Triplet Codes'** and I'm very proud of that paper because that was done, as I say, you know, without... it was just really knowing how to divide by four, actually, which spurred... and it's a good paper, that. And I think did a lot... did a lot to clear up things. > > And of course at the same time Francis had come to the conclusion that the code was degenerate, that in fact we can't assign it, we can't deduce it from first principles. We just have to go and find out what it is. Which is what... what had to be done. So the... and then we had these negotiations which went backwards and forwards, and I was really wanting to get out of South Africa and this was going... and in the middle of this I got an offer of a job at Berkeley, to go there. Because I'd known Gunther Stent because of my time there. I was very... I was very torn between knowing what to do. I further got an offer from Josh Lederberg to go there, and the reason I got this, I discovered... to go to Wisconsin, and the reason I got this, I discovered is that Gunther Stent put my name on one of his grants, and Josh Lederberg saw this and decided, 'Well, if he's going to get him, I'll make a counterbid'. So I had these letters. I actually also got a letter from a company in England, saying Sir Cyril Hinshelwood had written to them. > > That was very nice but I was pretty desperate to go. And then finally the... the MRC came through and we arranged to leave and the reason I left then was I had come to the conclusion that I really wanted to be a scientist, and that lots of people had stayed back in South Africa and had become, you know, important people there. But **the testing ground is at the centre, the personal testing ground, and you've got to go to the... the metropolis**, if I can call it that, and you've got to test yourself at the international level, because otherwise you don't know whether you're any good or not. And so that's really what it was, and... and since at that time I believed that in Africa... in South Africa the colour of my skin would always, if things changed, make me an outcast, because that's the way it looked at that time. I just decided that I would just go and do science and that's how I went back and that was... that was a conscious decision. > > Over this period, yes. I... this correspondence exists of course and a lot of it is in Judson's book, and in this we... the idea was we would do the gene protein problem. We would tackle this problem in bacteriophage, and so a lab would be set up and... and in fact this... this... so this was the idea: we'd all get together and we'd do this work.

There's a club in Oxford called the Alembic Club which was for the discussion of chemistry, and I can remember – I think it must have been either late '53 or early '54 but certainly while I was at Oxford – of going to a lecture that was given by Fred Sanger and was on the structure of insulin, and he showed how he deduced the structure. I know he had a wonderful set of little blocks which he turned over to face the audience as he determined the little pieces of a structure, and the thing that struck me, because of course protein structure then was in a total impossible thing, and the thing that really impressed me was at the end of this lecture **Sir Robert Robinson stood up and said the following. He said, 'Dr Sanger has made proteins part of chemistry. He's actually shown this remarkable fact that these things have a chemical structure in the form of their sequence of amino acids.'** > > And until that time, you know, no one actually believed it. They all thought that they were polymers and things just joined together. There's something called the Bergmann-Niemann Hypothesis which said that things occurred with a frequency according to their abundance so they were repetitive structures, which of course you can't do very well because many things would come to occupy the same position so you can't have something that occurs every second position and another thing every third position, because what happens at position number six? You have a conflict. > > However, that was the state, and that I think was another signal achievement in pushing the subject on. But of course you see that again wasn't something that most people were doing, and Fred himself was always a fringe person in the biochemistry department here in Cambridge, and it's only when Fred left the biochemistry department and joined with us to go up the hill to make the Laboratory on Molecular Biology, but that'll come later.","section":84,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0.021884405476620426,0,0.06565321642986127,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,0,0.021884405476620426,0,0.10942202738310214,0,0.021884405476620426,-0.04376881095324085,0.04376881095324085,0,0,0,0.5689945423921311,0,0,0,0,-0.04376881095324085,0,0,0.13130643285972254,-0.021884405476620426,0.28449727119606555,-0.021884405476620426,0.021884405476620426,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,0,0.021884405476620426,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,0.021884405476620426,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04376881095324085,0.021884405476620426,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,-0.021884405476620426,0.13130643285972254,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.021884405476620426,0,0,-0.04376881095324085,0,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,-0.06565321642986127,0.0875376219064817,0,0,0,0,-0.06565321642986127,0.021884405476620426,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0.021884405476620426,0,0,-0.04376881095324085,0,0,0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.021884405476620426,0,-0.0875376219064817,0,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0.04376881095324085,-0.13130643285972254,0,-0.06565321642986127,0.021884405476620426,-0.04376881095324085,0,0,0,-0.021884405476620426,0,-0.021884405476620426,0.06565321642986127,0,0,-0.10942202738310214,0.021884405476620426,-0.10942202738310214,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.021884405476620426,0.13130643285972254,0,0,0,0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,0,-0.04376881095324085,0,0,0.04376881095324085,0,0.3501504876259268,0,0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,0,0,0.0875376219064817,0,0,0,0,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,-0.021884405476620426,0.021884405476620426,0,0.06565321642986127,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04376881095324085,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.021884405476620426,0,-0.06565321642986127,0.021884405476620426,-0.04376881095324085,0,-0.021884405476620426,0,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,-0.0875376219064817,0,0,0,0,0.021884405476620426,0,0,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,0,0.19695964928958384,0,0,0,0.04376881095324085,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06565321642986127,0,-0.021884405476620426,0,-0.021884405476620426,0.06565321642986127,0,0,0,0.021884405476620426,-0.021884405476620426,0.0875376219064817,0,0,-0.0875376219064817,0,0,0.06565321642986127,0,0,-0.021884405476620426,0.04376881095324085,0,0,0,0,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0.06565321642986127,-0.021884405476620426,0,-0.04376881095324085,0.06565321642986127,0,0,0,0.04376881095324085,0,0,0,0.021884405476620426,0,0.021884405476620426,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,-0.04376881095324085,0,0,0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,0.15319083833634298,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.021884405476620426,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,-0.021884405476620426,0.021884405476620426,-0.021884405476620426,0.10942202738310214,-0.04376881095324085,0.06565321642986127,0,0,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0.021884405476620426,-0.021884405476620426,0,-0.021884405476620426,0.04376881095324085,0,0,0,0,0,0.10942202738310214,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.021884405476620426,-0.021884405476620426,0.04376881095324085,-0.06565321642986127,0.04376881095324085,0,0,0,0.30638167667268595,-0.04376881095324085,0,-0.06565321642986127,0,-0.021884405476620426,0.021884405476620426,0,0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,0,0,0.021884405476620426,-0.021884405476620426,0,0,0.021884405476620426,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-85-1","text":"> Well I arrived in Cambridge.

It wasn't a tenured appointment, it was a short-term appointment, and this was in the end of December 1956, and we arrived here in Cambridge to take up the appointment from 1st of 1957. > > And we had to find places to live – it was very, very difficult, I mean, just adapting to this. The laboratory had to be built up from scratch, there weren't any kitchens and so on, and in fact we set about organising a laboratory to do phage work. And our dish washing was in our office, and from that day... there were seven desks in this office, it was mixed up with crystallographers; we had a bench in a chemical lab, and a number of people were hired including Leslie Barnett. Leslie Barnett was then a computer girl, that... in those politically incorrect times this referred to people who actually did the calculations for crystallography on mechanical calculators and there was something known as **the three-girl method**; that is you got three girls to estimate the density and took the average of their estimation. So, I mean, it was that, and then she joined me, and... because she had a degree in biology... and Kate Wilkins joined us, who stayed with us, and she started to do our dish washing and our preparation. > > And we got a lab going so that by the time the gang arrived in 19... at the... in September of that year, I'd already done quite a lot of experiments, and we were able to do experiments and one of the things that we started to do – already we were doing then – was to work on bacteriophage. This bacteriophage could be grown on E. coli, and we did this because we could purify it very easily and we could get lots of it. > > And there were wonderful episodes of how we needed to grow large amounts of this, so I conceived of the idea of growing them in a washing-machine and there was a... because that had... there was a Hoover washing machine, I remember, which was... from the top, and had a pump which circulated everything and I thought: well, you know this is exactly what we need to grow large quantities of... of phage, because we could grow them in this and then we could inoculate them. And so I wrote to the Hoover company, they gave me a washing machine and... in which we grew things, and we could only grow them once, and then nothing grew and the reason for that unfortunately is that the phosphate media so corroded the aluminium that in fact the thing was just useless. > > But however it... it was developing all of these things to... to make the material and that is where I... that is also during this time I started to work with the electron microscope. Now the reason to do this was simply that I thought we could just take bacteriophage apart, you know, because it was like a little thing and we could do what we called an anatomical dissection of it. Whereas all the other people said, 'No you have to treat it as a mixture of proteins and go on to columns and separate them', so **the whole idea that you could actually isolate chunks of it as a preliminary was... was certainly something that no one accepted at the time**, and this, we were able to show, could be done, and we did it in very simple ways. > > For example I discovered that if you put bacteriophage at pH2 – just acidified it – it went into a mass, and when you digested it with a mixture of enzymes you were only left with one little component, namely what came to be called later was the tail sheath. And so we did a lot of experiments like this and then we could actually start to produce these... these pieces of the phage.","section":85,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.04416722451143662,-0.011041806127859155,0.02208361225571831,-0.011041806127859155,0,0,0,0,0.04416722451143662,0,0,0,0.011041806127859155,-0.033125418383577465,0,-0.02208361225571831,0,-0.011041806127859155,0.06625083676715493,0,0.07729264289501409,-0.02208361225571831,0,-0.08833444902287324,0.011041806127859155,0,0.033125418383577465,-0.011041806127859155,0.4416722451143662,-0.011041806127859155,0,0,0,-0.04416722451143662,0.055209030639295775,0,0.2760451531964789,0,0.43063043898650705,0,0,-0.04416722451143662,0,0,0,0,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.02208361225571831,0,0,0.02208361225571831,-0.011041806127859155,0.011041806127859155,0,0,-0.055209030639295775,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,0,0.055209030639295775,-0.02208361225571831,0,-0.02208361225571831,0.02208361225571831,-0.011041806127859155,0.011041806127859155,0,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.033125418383577465,0,0,0.04416722451143662,-0.011041806127859155,0.07729264289501409,0,0.011041806127859155,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02208361225571831,0,-0.011041806127859155,0.04416722451143662,0,0.033125418383577465,-0.06625083676715493,0,0,0.033125418383577465,-0.02208361225571831,0,-0.02208361225571831,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.04416722451143662,0.011041806127859155,0,0.02208361225571831,-0.04416722451143662,0.033125418383577465,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,0,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.15458528579002817,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,0,0.011041806127859155,-0.02208361225571831,0.011041806127859155,0,0.033125418383577465,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.06625083676715493,0.04416722451143662,0,0,0,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.011041806127859155,-0.011041806127859155,0.18771070417360564,0,0.011041806127859155,-0.011041806127859155,0.011041806127859155,-0.04416722451143662,0,0,0,-0.02208361225571831,0,0,0.033125418383577465,-0.011041806127859155,0.2760451531964789,-0.02208361225571831,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,0,0,0,0.055209030639295775,-0.011041806127859155,0.02208361225571831,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.011041806127859155,0.1214598674064507,0,0.02208361225571831,0,0,-0.055209030639295775,0,0,0.011041806127859155,0,0.02208361225571831,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.011041806127859155,0.011041806127859155,0,0,-0.011041806127859155,0.011041806127859155,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,0,0.055209030639295775,-0.055209030639295775,0.033125418383577465,-0.06625083676715493,0,-0.04416722451143662,0,0,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.02208361225571831,0,0,0,0,0,-0.011041806127859155,0.011041806127859155,0,0.04416722451143662,0,0.011041806127859155,0,0.20979431642932395,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.04416722451143662,0,0,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,0,0.011041806127859155,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.033125418383577465,0.011041806127859155,0,0.011041806127859155,0,0.033125418383577465,-0.011041806127859155,0,0,0,-0.02208361225571831,0.011041806127859155,0,0.18771070417360564,0,0,0,0.011041806127859155,-0.06625083676715493,0,0,0.02208361225571831,-0.033125418383577465,0.011041806127859155,0,0.011041806127859155,0,0.033125418383577465,0,0.04416722451143662,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.011041806127859155,0.011041806127859155,-0.011041806127859155,0.011041806127859155,0,0.011041806127859155,-0.2650033470686197,0.011041806127859155,-0.011041806127859155,0,0,0.011041806127859155,-0.033125418383577465,0.011041806127859155,0,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,0,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.011041806127859155,0.04416722451143662,0,0.04416722451143662,0,0.011041806127859155,-0.033125418383577465,0.011041806127859155,0,0.011041806127859155,-0.02208361225571831,0.02208361225571831,-0.011041806127859155,0,0,0.011041806127859155,0,0,-0.011041806127859155,0,-0.011041806127859155,0.011041806127859155,0,0,-0.011041806127859155,0.055209030639295775,0,0.02208361225571831,0,0.02208361225571831,-0.011041806127859155,0.02208361225571831,-0.02208361225571831,0.011041806127859155,0,0.011041806127859155,0,0,0,0.04416722451143662,-0.04416722451143662,0.02208361225571831,0,0.06625083676715493,0,0,0,0.2760451531964789,-0.08833444902287324,0.011041806127859155,-0.033125418383577465,0.011041806127859155,0,0.04416722451143662,0,0.011041806127859155,-0.033125418383577465,0.011041806127859155,-0.011041806127859155,0,0,0.06625083676715493,-0.055209030639295775,0.011041806127859155,0,0.02208361225571831,0,0.011041806127859155,0,0.011041806127859155,0]},{"id":"transcript-86-1","text":"> Now, one of the interesting things which happened during the time, and actually was a side-effect of all of this work, was **the invention of negative staining**. Now, this is a very remarkable... technology because what it did was it took electron microscopy out of the hands of the elite and gave it to the people, basically. > > Now in those days if you needed to do electron microscopy you needed to have a professional electron microscopist. This is someone who knew how to shadow things with uranium, and he would evaporate uranium onto these objects and put them on the machine so that you could actually visualise them. Because... of course the electron microscope can see small things but it needs contrast in order to see them and this... biological objects don't have enough contrast – you need some kind of heavy... heavier compound there, with more electrons, that is – and so shadowing was part of the profession, and these electron microscopists had to be pampered, and if you were, say, working in the life sciences you had to find a collaborator who of course exacted a very high price for this collaboration. > > And I started to work with... with someone called Bob Horne, who was a very interesting chap, was working with the electron micro... microscope in the solid state physics group here in the Cavendish and... and we had great difficulties in visualising these things and doing the shadowing; it was all terribly slow. So I decided – having come from a background of cytology – I would try and stain these. And... and so I knew you had to stain them with heavy metals, and so I got hold of phosphotungstic acid, and the first thing I did is I measured its pH, and I discovered its pH was three. So I said, 'I don't put biological objects into such acid conditions', so I neutralised it and I took all these pieces of virus, and I sprayed them onto this grid, and we took them over and we looked at them. > > Now Bob Horne said, 'That's a mess, it's a total mess; everything...' But then I saw something, and I knew immediately what it was, and I said, 'This is called negative staining'. And how did I know this? Because in my medical course I had learnt to show how you'd look at treponema. Treponema is the age... spirochaetes. Treponema is the agent that causes syphilis, and one of the things you diagnose is you put a drop on a slide and you put Indian ink in it, and you see the treponemas as white objects transmitting the lights, swimming in the sea of ink, and **this is called negative staining, and this was invented in the 19th century for the optical microscope and we... and I understood that this was the exact image of this, but for the electron microscope**, so with this we could produce remarkable images. > > And it had two effects. One is it allowed at least the electron microscopy of small objects to go. But what happened is it took all the people working in virology and gave them a tool that they could all use and really wiped out the profession of electron microscopist in a biological lab because everybody could just do it. And of course it's been the... it's been a wonderful technique, it's been developed by... by many people, but it's again... I mean, in that sense, it's... it's being able to say, **'This picture, I've seen something like this before'**, and of course now I know it's got to do with syphilis. Of course you can't explain to someone that this is where venereal disease comes in but it's effectively... it's the images that map on to each other.","section":86,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.012045570273080244,0,0,0,0,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0.07227342163848147,-0.03613671081924073,0.012045570273080244,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.012045570273080244,0.012045570273080244,-0.03613671081924073,0,0,0.07227342163848147,0,0.06022785136540122,-0.012045570273080244,0.012045570273080244,-0.1084101324577222,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,-0.03613671081924073,0.5179595217424505,0,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,-0.03613671081924073,0,0,0.2168202649154444,0,0.44568610010396903,0,0.012045570273080244,-0.012045570273080244,0,0,0,0,0.012045570273080244,-0.012045570273080244,0,0,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012045570273080244,0,0,0,0.03613671081924073,0,0.03613671081924073,-0.02409114054616049,0.012045570273080244,-0.012045570273080244,0,0,0.012045570273080244,-0.012045570273080244,0,0,0.012045570273080244,-0.012045570273080244,0,0,0,-0.012045570273080244,0.03613671081924073,0,0,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0,0,0.012045570273080244,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0.012045570273080244,-0.012045570273080244,0.03613671081924073,-0.012045570273080244,0.012045570273080244,-0.09636456218464196,0,-0.012045570273080244,0.012045570273080244,0,0,0,0.012045570273080244,0,0,-0.012045570273080244,0.012045570273080244,-0.04818228109232098,0,0,0,0,0.012045570273080244,-0.012045570273080244,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,-0.012045570273080244,0.012045570273080244,-0.02409114054616049,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,0,0,-0.1927291243692839,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0.012045570273080244,0,0,-0.012045570273080244,0.08431899191156171,0,0.012045570273080244,-0.02409114054616049,0.03613671081924073,-0.03613671081924073,0,-0.012045570273080244,0.012045570273080244,-0.012045570273080244,0.012045570273080244,0,0,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0,-0.012045570273080244,0.16863798382312342,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.012045570273080244,0.04818228109232098,-0.012045570273080244,0,0,0,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.012045570273080244,0.03613671081924073,0,0.12045570273080244,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,0,0.12045570273080244,0,0.012045570273080244,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,-0.012045570273080244,0.06022785136540122,0,0.07227342163848147,0,0.012045570273080244,-0.012045570273080244,0.012045570273080244,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.03613671081924073,0.012045570273080244,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0,-0.04818228109232098,0.02409114054616049,-0.012045570273080244,0.012045570273080244,-0.06022785136540122,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,0,0,-0.02409114054616049,0.03613671081924073,0,0.03613671081924073,0,0,-0.06022785136540122,0,0,0.06022785136540122,0,0,-0.02409114054616049,0.1325012730038827,-0.02409114054616049,0.012045570273080244,-0.012045570273080244,0.012045570273080244,0,0,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,0,0.03613671081924073,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0.1084101324577222,0,0,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.03613671081924073,0.07227342163848147,0,0.2650025460077654,0,0,0,0.012045570273080244,-0.14454684327696293,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,0,0,0,0.04818228109232098,-0.012045570273080244,0.012045570273080244,0,0,0,0,0,0.012045570273080244,0,0.012045570273080244,-0.012045570273080244,0.012045570273080244,-0.07227342163848147,0.012045570273080244,-0.03613671081924073,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,-0.07227342163848147,0,0,0,-0.12045570273080244,0,0,0.03613671081924073,-0.012045570273080244,0,0,0.03613671081924073,0,0.012045570273080244,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.04818228109232098,0,0,0,-0.04818228109232098,0.06022785136540122,0,0.012045570273080244,-0.012045570273080244,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,-0.012045570273080244,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03613671081924073,0,0,0,0.08431899191156171,-0.02409114054616049,0.012045570273080244,0,0.012045570273080244,-0.02409114054616049,0.02409114054616049,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.012045570273080244,0.02409114054616049,0,0.012045570273080244,-0.012045570273080244,0.012045570273080244,0,0.27704811628084564,-0.09636456218464196,0.012045570273080244,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0.03613671081924073,0,0,-0.06022785136540122,0,0,0.012045570273080244,-0.02409114054616049,0.012045570273080244,-0.07227342163848147,0,0,0,-0.02409114054616049,0,-0.02409114054616049,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-87-1","text":"> Now I didn't pursue virus structure myself, because it was just a means to getting to the phage, but of course that sort of revolutionised how people could look at particles of all sizes, and for us it was just a tool that was very important, because also it generated I think in biology the ability through – of course the phage work itself – to start to think now about macromolecular assemblies which I think have become the important underlying thing in cell biology. **The molecular biology of the cell is how bunches of molecules get together and interact** and this was one of the methods that could do it. > > However, we did go on and we had a hilarious time here. Seymour Benzer felt the cold very severely. In fact, he was ready to go home. He came in... in October, and they were so cold here he was ready to go home, but I dissuaded him. I used to come and make a fire for him, and, you know, help him to keep warm, but Seymour's the only person that I know walks around with a sweater in Death Valley, you know the temperature's 120°F, he's always been cold. He always likes to sleep late. He's an owl. That is, he stays up all night. I have in varying parts of my life been an owl and a lark, and sometimes both, that is get up early and go to bed late, but Seymour was this, and I remember they called me up... *Time Magazine* called me that year because Beadle won the Nobel Prize, and they called me from London, and they said could they speak to... to Dr Benzer, and I said, 'Dr Benzer is still asleep'. > > Then they said, 'Did I know where to find Doctor Garrod?' So I said, 'Just hold on a moment, I'll check up'. Now I have to tell you what this is about. This is Archibald Garrod who's thought... thought to be... you know who is the real founder of modern biochemical genetics, the physician who deduced alkaptonuria as a biochemical defect and of course had long since died, and what I went to look up was his obituary to see where he was buried, you see, and so I could give them directions to the Highgate Cemetery where I thought they might be able to get him. In fact, I said, **'You're probably more likely to wake him up than you are Seymour Benzer.'** > > So... so Seymour did this. Then Seymour, George and I and Sewell Champe, who was a student that Seymour brought with him for this, we decided to have a lunch club. It was... of course food in England was atrocious in those days. You had the choice between a bad Chinese lunch and a terrible Chinese lunch, so we decided we would form a lunch club and we would cook for each other. And one person would go around, collect all the ingredients and then make a meal which we would all eat and such was the impulse to outdo each other that in fact people would start cooking two days before – George in particular, who was a gourmet... George Streisinger was a gourmet, and he actually went to Yarmouth to get mussels one day, so we could have the moules marinière, and this got to the stage we're spending more time on preparing these grand lunches, and of course what happened was Seymour killed it all because he came in one day when it was his turn with a rather shy smile on his face and produced four packets of fish and chips, said he'd got up too late to prepare the lunch, so that was the end of the lunch.","section":87,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.026776377054529576,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.026776377054529576,-0.013388188527264788,0.026776377054529576,0,0,-0.013388188527264788,0.026776377054529576,-0.08032913116358872,0,0,0.05355275410905915,-0.013388188527264788,0.013388188527264788,-0.013388188527264788,0.013388188527264788,-0.1071055082181183,0.013388188527264788,0,0.013388188527264788,0,0.4685865984542676,0,0,-0.12049369674538309,0,-0.06694094263632394,0.013388188527264788,-0.013388188527264788,0.34809290170888446,-0.04016456558179436,0.38825746729067884,0,0.026776377054529576,-0.013388188527264788,0,0,0,0,0.013388188527264788,-0.026776377054529576,0,-0.013388188527264788,0,0,0.04016456558179436,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.013388188527264788,0.09371731969085352,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.013388188527264788,0.026776377054529576,-0.013388188527264788,0.013388188527264788,-0.026776377054529576,0,0,0.04016456558179436,0,0.05355275410905915,-0.013388188527264788,0,0,0,0,0.013388188527264788,0,0,0,0,-0.04016456558179436,0,0,0,-0.04016456558179436,0.04016456558179436,-0.026776377054529576,0.026776377054529576,-0.013388188527264788,0.013388188527264788,0,0.026776377054529576,-0.013388188527264788,0,0,0.026776377054529576,0,0,0,0,-0.05355275410905915,0.013388188527264788,0,0.04016456558179436,0,0,-0.04016456558179436,0,-0.013388188527264788,0.013388188527264788,-0.026776377054529576,0.013388188527264788,-0.06694094263632394,0,-0.026776377054529576,0,0,0.026776377054529576,-0.09371731969085352,0,0,0,0,0,-0.013388188527264788,0.013388188527264788,0,0.013388188527264788,0,0.08032913116358872,0,0,-0.013388188527264788,0.05355275410905915,-0.026776377054529576,0.013388188527264788,-0.013388188527264788,0,-0.013388188527264788,0.026776377054529576,0,0,0,0.013388188527264788,0,0,-0.013388188527264788,0.17404645085444223,0,0.013388188527264788,-0.013388188527264788,0.013388188527264788,-0.026776377054529576,0.013388188527264788,-0.026776377054529576,0,-0.04016456558179436,0,-0.013388188527264788,0.08032913116358872,0,0.14727007379991267,-0.04016456558179436,0,-0.04016456558179436,0.013388188527264788,-0.013388188527264788,0,0,0,-0.04016456558179436,0,0,0.013388188527264788,0,0,0,0,0,0.08032913116358872,0,0.06694094263632394,0,0.013388188527264788,-0.013388188527264788,0,0,0,-0.08032913116358872,0.013388188527264788,0,0,-0.04016456558179436,0,-0.013388188527264788,0,-0.026776377054529576,0.04016456558179436,-0.026776377054529576,0,-0.013388188527264788,0,0,0,-0.06694094263632394,0.013388188527264788,-0.013388188527264788,0,-0.16065826232717745,0.05355275410905915,0,0.04016456558179436,-0.04016456558179436,0,-0.026776377054529576,0,-0.013388188527264788,0.013388188527264788,-0.04016456558179436,0,0,0.013388188527264788,-0.013388188527264788,0.013388188527264788,-0.026776377054529576,0.013388188527264788,0,0,-0.013388188527264788,0,0,0.24098739349076617,0,0.013388188527264788,-0.04016456558179436,0,0,0,0,0.013388188527264788,-0.013388188527264788,0,-0.013388188527264788,0,-0.09371731969085352,0.013388188527264788,0,0.013388188527264788,0,0,0,0,0,0.013388188527264788,0,0.013388188527264788,0,0,-0.06694094263632394,0,-0.05355275410905915,0.09371731969085352,0,0.026776377054529576,-0.026776377054529576,0,-0.09371731969085352,0,0,0,-0.026776377054529576,0,0,0.09371731969085352,-0.026776377054529576,0,-0.013388188527264788,0.09371731969085352,0,0,-0.013388188527264788,0,-0.013388188527264788,0,0,0,-0.13388188527264788,0.013388188527264788,0,0,0,0,-0.06694094263632394,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.16065826232717745,0,0.013388188527264788,0,0.013388188527264788,0,0,-0.026776377054529576,0,-0.05355275410905915,0,0,0,-0.026776377054529576,0.06694094263632394,-0.013388188527264788,0.013388188527264788,-0.04016456558179436,0,0,0,-0.06694094263632394,0,-0.013388188527264788,0,0,0.04016456558179436,0,0.013388188527264788,0,0.013388188527264788,-0.08032913116358872,0,0,0.1071055082181183,-0.026776377054529576,0.013388188527264788,-0.013388188527264788,0,-0.013388188527264788,0.013388188527264788,0,0,0,0.08032913116358872,-0.013388188527264788,0.06694094263632394,-0.026776377054529576,0.013388188527264788,0,0.2142110164362366,-0.04016456558179436,0,0,0,0,0.026776377054529576,-0.013388188527264788,0.013388188527264788,0,0,0,0.026776377054529576,0,0.04016456558179436,-0.05355275410905915,0,0,0.026776377054529576,0,0,-0.026776377054529576,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-88-1","text":"> In Cambridge, the laboratory as it was then called in the '50s – the Unit, the MRC Unit for the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems. This had been set up by the MRC for Max Perutz some years ago with the idea that crystallography could be of importance for medical research. The Medical Research Council was in fact persuaded by Keilin, who was a very formidable scientist – David Keilin – and of course who was interested in iron proteins. David Keilin discovered the cytochromes in the '20s, and this unit had been set up with the unlikely program of **determining the structure of protein molecules by X-ray crystallography**, which just seemed totally impossible for things of that size. And of course this was something that Max had worked on and of course there were forerunners, namely Bernal. > > Now, technically this was very difficult to do. First of all, the data were very hard to record, because the X-ray sources were not powerful enough. And so one of the things that became a part of that group – and that's why they were in the Cavendish Laboratory – was in fact to develop the physical instrumentation to do this. And of course this is where the rotating anode tube had been invented so that a more intense source of X-rays became available and so these crystals could be photographed. > > Now, one of the problems in doing X-ray crystallography is of course what's called **the phase problem**. What you measure is the amplitude of the wave and that is the square, but you don't know whether it's minus or plus. And if you have to look at, say, 400 reflections, this means you have two to the four hundred possibilities and so you can't do it in any other way but to determine phase. And for a long time the haemoglobin work that Max was doing just went very slowly, and in fact nearly all the work done up to almost the last time was wrong. In fact, Francis started by working on haemoglobin Pattersons and came to the conclusion it was a waste of time. Jim came to the lab to do X-ray crystallography on tobacco mosaic virus in the lab, because he thought that he could try and tell something about this. So Jim Watson came here. John Kendrew had joined Max Perutz after the war and he had started to work on another protein called myoglobin.","section":88,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.034964180063753285,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017482090031876642,-0.017482090031876642,0,-0.017482090031876642,0.017482090031876642,-0.017482090031876642,0.034964180063753285,-0.034964180063753285,0,0,0.10489254019125985,0,0.15733881028688979,0,0,-0.08741045015938322,0,-0.017482090031876642,0.034964180063753285,0,0.6293552411475591,0,0,-0.017482090031876642,0,-0.06992836012750657,0.017482090031876642,0,0.2097850803825197,-0.034964180063753285,0.2797134405100263,0,0,-0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,-0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,-0.052446270095629924,0.017482090031876642,0,0,-0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017482090031876642,-0.034964180063753285,0,-0.034964180063753285,0.034964180063753285,0,0.034964180063753285,0,0.08741045015938322,0,0,0,0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,0,-0.017482090031876642,0.017482090031876642,-0.017482090031876642,0.06992836012750657,-0.034964180063753285,0,-0.017482090031876642,0.08741045015938322,-0.017482090031876642,0.017482090031876642,0,0.017482090031876642,0,0,-0.034964180063753285,0,-0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,0,0,-0.052446270095629924,0.034964180063753285,0,0.017482090031876642,0,0.034964180063753285,-0.034964180063753285,0,-0.06992836012750657,0.034964180063753285,0,0,-0.052446270095629924,0,-0.034964180063753285,0,-0.017482090031876642,0.034964180063753285,-0.13985672025501314,0,0,0.017482090031876642,-0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.034964180063753285,0,0.017482090031876642,0,0.08741045015938322,0,0,0,0,0,0.017482090031876642,0,0.017482090031876642,-0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,0,0.2097850803825197,-0.017482090031876642,0,0,0.017482090031876642,-0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,0,0,-0.034964180063753285,0.017482090031876642,0,0.244749260446273,0,0,-0.017482090031876642,0,-0.017482090031876642,0,0,0.034964180063753285,-0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017482090031876642,0,0.052446270095629924,0,0.052446270095629924,0,0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,0,0,0.017482090031876642,0,0.017482090031876642,-0.034964180063753285,0.034964180063753285,0,0,-0.017482090031876642,0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,0.017482090031876642,-0.017482090031876642,0.017482090031876642,-0.034964180063753285,0,-0.017482090031876642,0,-0.034964180063753285,0.017482090031876642,-0.017482090031876642,0,0,0.017482090031876642,-0.017482090031876642,0,0,0.017482090031876642,0,0,-0.052446270095629924,0.017482090031876642,0,0,-0.017482090031876642,0,-0.034964180063753285,0.17482090031876643,0,0,0,0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017482090031876642,0,-0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,-0.034964180063753285,0.034964180063753285,0,0.017482090031876642,-0.052446270095629924,0.034964180063753285,-0.017482090031876642,0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,0.017482090031876642,0,0.06992836012750657,0,0.034964180063753285,0,0.017482090031876642,-0.06992836012750657,0.017482090031876642,0,0,-0.06992836012750657,0,0,0.017482090031876642,0,0.034964180063753285,0,0.052446270095629924,0,0,0,0,-0.017482090031876642,0,0,0.017482090031876642,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.034964180063753285,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.052446270095629924,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06992836012750657,0,0,0,-0.08741045015938322,0.034964180063753285,-0.017482090031876642,0.052446270095629924,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017482090031876642,0.017482090031876642,-0.052446270095629924,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13985672025501314,0,0.017482090031876642,-0.017482090031876642,0.017482090031876642,-0.017482090031876642,0.017482090031876642,0,0.052446270095629924,0,0.017482090031876642,-0.017482090031876642,0.06992836012750657,-0.017482090031876642,0,0,0.2971955305419029,-0.034964180063753285,0,-0.034964180063753285,0,0,0,0,0,-0.034964180063753285,0,0,0,-0.017482090031876642,0.017482090031876642,-0.034964180063753285,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06992836012750657]},{"id":"transcript-89-1","text":"> One of the things that John did which was absolutely very far-sighted was he realised computers were going to be very important in this field.

But in the meantime we were working... had started work on chemical mutagenesis. > > Now, Seymour had been doing work on the induction of mutants by chemicals before he came and had shown that if you incorporated 5-Bromouracil into the phage, you got mutants. If you treated it with various reagents you got mutants and so on, and what had been developed was this idea of **mutational spectra** and we had also started some work on this but not... in a desultory way. What was the idea? The idea was not only would we tell the co-linearity but we'd actually decode the protein this way you see so if we could get a chemical reagent that we knew changed guanine to adenine, you know that is made that mutation, and we could then see what amino acid changed, we will have then been able to work out the genetic code. That was the dream. Now I have to say it never got done that way or just excepting one thing which... which came later and not by... so the idea was let's do chemical mutagenesis. > > We had all of these spectra, and the question was: what did these spectra mean? One remarkable thing is that the induced mutants were at different places from the spontaneous mutants, and what we knew was that the induced mutants could be made to revert by the same class of reagents that induced them but none of the spontaneous mutants could be made to revert by the so-called base analogue mutagens, and this was a great puzzle. So I thought we must go and do something completely different, so I said to Seymour, 'You know there this is dye **proflavine** which I've been interested in for many time – it combines with DNA and there's a paper by Bob DeMars'. Proflavine also interferes with phage assembly; we knew that as well. > > Now since there was a paper by Bob DeMars... he says he's made mutants with proflavine, so why don't we do an R2 spectrum? And Lesley Barnett started then to do this, started to make mutants with proflavine and started to map them and what do you know we found that none of these proflavine mutants could be induced to revert by base analogues and none of the base analogue mutants could be induced to revert by proflavine. So we had these two spectra and this proflavine, and this was very hard to explain and at the time we were exploring then other reagents. We made mutant spectra with hydrazine, with acid... with photodynamic inactivation. I remember I made mutants with acid, but just by treating them at pH4.5. You... you get the phage, we know that this pH bases are removed, they get depurinated and then from these you can get mutants. > > I then measured the pH of Coca-Cola and I discovered it's considerably lower than 4.5, so I thought of writing up a paper on acid mutagenesis, saying I had done this by putting bacteriophages in Coca-Cola and here we are we have these **Coca-Cola induced mutants** and sending it to the Coca-Cola company saying, 'I'm at a loss to know where to publish this, have you any useful suggestions?' Needless to say, we didn't do it, but of course it would be interesting today, and I'm jolly sure that Coca-Cola will induce mutants as well; I mean vinegar on chips, that's the worst thing you can do. However, this is... that's aside. So we did many of these things and at the same time we were working on this.","section":90,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.06762092770801409,0,0,0,0,-0.011270154618002348,0,-0.011270154618002348,0.06762092770801409,0,0,0,0,-0.022540309236004696,0,0,0,0,0.12397170079802583,0,0.21413293774204462,-0.011270154618002348,0.011270154618002348,-0.12397170079802583,0.011270154618002348,0,0.05635077309001174,-0.022540309236004696,0.5071569578101056,-0.011270154618002348,0,-0.011270154618002348,0,-0.022540309236004696,0.033810463854007045,0,0.19159262850603992,0,0.3268344839220681,0,0,-0.022540309236004696,0,-0.022540309236004696,0,0,0,-0.033810463854007045,0.05635077309001174,-0.011270154618002348,0.011270154618002348,0,0.022540309236004696,0,0,0,0,-0.022540309236004696,0.011270154618002348,-0.022540309236004696,0,0,0.022540309236004696,0,0,0,0.011270154618002348,0,0,-0.011270154618002348,0,-0.011270154618002348,0,-0.022540309236004696,0,-0.022540309236004696,0,0,0,0,0.12397170079802583,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.011270154618002348,0,0,-0.011270154618002348,0.011270154618002348,0,0,0,0.04508061847200939,0,0.05635077309001174,-0.033810463854007045,0,0,0.011270154618002348,-0.06762092770801409,0,0,0.011270154618002348,0,0,-0.011270154618002348,0.011270154618002348,-0.022540309236004696,0.011270154618002348,0,0.022540309236004696,0,0.011270154618002348,-0.022540309236004696,0,-0.05635077309001174,0,0,0.011270154618002348,-0.05635077309001174,0,-0.011270154618002348,0,-0.011270154618002348,0.06762092770801409,-0.19159262850603992,0,-0.04508061847200939,0.022540309236004696,-0.022540309236004696,0.011270154618002348,0,0.011270154618002348,-0.04508061847200939,0,0,0.07889108232601644,-0.033810463854007045,0.011270154618002348,-0.033810463854007045,0.022540309236004696,-0.022540309236004696,0,-0.022540309236004696,0,0,0,0,0.011270154618002348,0,0,0,0.011270154618002348,-0.022540309236004696,0.04508061847200939,0,0,0,0.04508061847200939,-0.022540309236004696,0,0,0,0,0.04508061847200939,-0.011270154618002348,0.05635077309001174,0,0.21413293774204462,-0.05635077309001174,0,-0.011270154618002348,0,-0.011270154618002348,0,0,0.04508061847200939,0,0.011270154618002348,0,0,-0.033810463854007045,0,0,0,0,0.09016123694401879,0,0.033810463854007045,-0.011270154618002348,0,0,0.033810463854007045,0,0.011270154618002348,0,0.011270154618002348,0,0,0,0,-0.022540309236004696,0,-0.033810463854007045,0,0,0.011270154618002348,0,0.022540309236004696,0,0.033810463854007045,-0.05635077309001174,0.04508061847200939,0,0.011270154618002348,-0.033810463854007045,0.05635077309001174,-0.033810463854007045,0,-0.033810463854007045,0,-0.011270154618002348,0,0,0,-0.05635077309001174,0,-0.011270154618002348,0.022540309236004696,-0.011270154618002348,0,-0.022540309236004696,0,0,0,0,0.011270154618002348,-0.011270154618002348,0.13524185541602818,-0.011270154618002348,0,-0.022540309236004696,0.022540309236004696,0,0,0,0,0,0.011270154618002348,0,0,-0.011270154618002348,0.011270154618002348,-0.033810463854007045,0,0,0.011270154618002348,0,0.033810463854007045,0,0.07889108232601644,-0.07889108232601644,0.033810463854007045,0,0,0,0.011270154618002348,0,0.07889108232601644,0,0.011270154618002348,0,0.011270154618002348,-0.07889108232601644,0,0,0,0,0.011270154618002348,0,0.011270154618002348,-0.022540309236004696,0.05635077309001174,0,0.011270154618002348,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.033810463854007045,-0.33810463854007045,0,-0.011270154618002348,0,0,0,-0.10143139156202113,0,-0.011270154618002348,0,-0.18032247388803757,0.011270154618002348,0,0.033810463854007045,0,0,0,0,0,0.011270154618002348,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04508061847200939,0.011270154618002348,0,0.04508061847200939,0,0,0,0,-0.022540309236004696,0,-0.011270154618002348,0,0,0,0,0.022540309236004696,0,0.033810463854007045,0,0,0,0.10143139156202113,0,0.033810463854007045,-0.033810463854007045,0,0,0.022540309236004696,-0.05635077309001174,0.022540309236004696,0,0.04508061847200939,0,0.06762092770801409,-0.022540309236004696,0,0,0.20286278312404227,-0.11270154618002348,0,-0.011270154618002348,0,0,0,0,0,-0.022540309236004696,0,0,0,0,0.10143139156202113,-0.05635077309001174,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-91-1","text":"> Now, furthermore, at the same time, Francis had decided that, 'We've got to start working on protein synthesis and what we've got to do is to start working on these Transfer RNAs'. So he started together with... with John Littlewood and Mahlon Hoagland who came here in that great glorious year to start to see whether they could purify transfer RNA, and start to work on protein synthesis; and so, you know, this was the whole thing: could we prove the adaptor hypothesis? Could we decode this way? > > So we had all of these experiments going on and we had this wonderful group in that year. Seymour, George, Mahlon Hoagland. Mahlon Hoagland's great... great accomplishment that year was to perform the guitar in the Green Man pub in Grantchester. They still remember him there because he stayed in the house next door which is Byron Lodge and he still remembers this as well to become that. > > And... and now of course there were competitors in this field. That is having formulated this... this program, many people said, 'We'll do this as well', and one of the ones was Cyrus Leventhal and decided he'd also do a gene protein problem and he would do it with a bacterial gene. So it'd become... that is, he would do it with alkaline phosphates; they could purify this, they could do this. There were other people working with bacteriophage and of course the... the other person who did it as well, later on, was Charles Yanofsky but Charles Yanofsky is a very interesting man in that he decided to work on tryptophan biosynthesis as a graduate student, starting with David Bonner, and he's just worked on that all of his life and fed into this whatever problems emerged. > > So he didn't start from this other end and that's different you see because we said, 'You have to get a system to prove this', and of course that I think is also very important and something which of course you learn, and something which I think is... is absolutely still important today and I'm still doing it which is that **once you've formulated a question, and if it's general enough, it means you can solve it in any biological system. So what you want to do is to find experimentally which is the best one to solve that problem** and as long as it's general enough you will find the solution there and **the choice of the experimental object remains one of the most important things to do in biology** and which sort of is, I think, one of the great places to do innovative work.","section":91,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0.01702759856193218,-0.03405519712386436,0,0,0.01702759856193218,-0.10216559137159308,0,-0.03405519712386436,0,0,0.06811039424772872,0,0.17027598561932178,-0.01702759856193218,0,-0.10216559137159308,0,0,0,0,0.45974516117216885,-0.01702759856193218,0,-0.06811039424772872,0,-0.03405519712386436,0.01702759856193218,0,0.27244157699091487,-0.01702759856193218,0.3916347669244401,0,0,-0.03405519712386436,0.01702759856193218,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0.01702759856193218,0,0.03405519712386436,0,0,0,0,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,0,0.01702759856193218,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0.01702759856193218,-0.01702759856193218,0.01702759856193218,0,0,-0.01702759856193218,0.01702759856193218,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,-0.01702759856193218,0,-0.03405519712386436,0,0,0,0,0.1532483870573896,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,0,0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,0,-0.05108279568579654,0.06811039424772872,-0.01702759856193218,0.01702759856193218,-0.10216559137159308,0.05108279568579654,0,0.10216559137159308,0,0,0,0,0,0.01702759856193218,0,0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,0.06811039424772872,-0.08513799280966089,0.03405519712386436,0,0,-0.01702759856193218,0.01702759856193218,-0.05108279568579654,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01702759856193218,0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,0.06811039424772872,-0.22135878130511832,0,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0.03405519712386436,0,0.03405519712386436,-0.05108279568579654,0,-0.01702759856193218,0.01702759856193218,-0.01702759856193218,0,-0.05108279568579654,0,0,0,-0.03405519712386436,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1532483870573896,0,0.01702759856193218,-0.01702759856193218,0.01702759856193218,-0.01702759856193218,0,-0.05108279568579654,0,0,0,-0.01702759856193218,0.01702759856193218,0,0.25541397842898267,-0.03405519712386436,0,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,0,0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,0,0,0.01702759856193218,0,0,-0.01702759856193218,0.10216559137159308,0,0.03405519712386436,0,0,-0.01702759856193218,0.05108279568579654,0,0,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0.03405519712386436,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,-0.01702759856193218,0.01702759856193218,-0.06811039424772872,0,-0.01702759856193218,0,-0.03405519712386436,0,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,-0.06811039424772872,0,-0.06811039424772872,0,-0.01702759856193218,0,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0.03405519712386436,-0.01702759856193218,0.01702759856193218,0,0.06811039424772872,0,0,-0.05108279568579654,0,0,0,-0.03405519712386436,0,-0.05108279568579654,0.06811039424772872,0,0,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01702759856193218,0.01702759856193218,-0.06811039424772872,0,0,0,0,0.01702759856193218,0,0.01702759856193218,0,0.05108279568579654,0,0,0,0.01702759856193218,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0.1532483870573896,0,0,0,0,-0.20433118274318615,0,0,0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,0.08513799280966089,-0.03405519712386436,0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.13622078849545743,0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,0,-0.05108279568579654,0,0,0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,0.1532483870573896,0,0,0,0.05108279568579654,0,0.01702759856193218,0,0.03405519712386436,0,0,0,0.03405519712386436,0,0.03405519712386436,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,0,0.03405519712386436,0,0,-0.01702759856193218,0,0,0.06811039424772872,-0.01702759856193218,0.03405519712386436,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06811039424772872,0,0.03405519712386436,-0.01702759856193218,0,-0.01702759856193218,0.20433118274318615,-0.10216559137159308,0,-0.03405519712386436,0,-0.01702759856193218,0.03405519712386436,0,0.01702759856193218,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03405519712386436,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03405519712386436]},{"id":"transcript-92-1","text":"> And so you have to say, 'Well, you know the diversity is so large...'

For example, at one time we explored the following possibility that the physicists – that is, the crystallography – would stay in the Cavendish, and that Francis and myself and our group, we would go to the genetics department, and Francis effectively applied for the Chair of Genetics here and was turned down. **Francis Crick was not thought to know anything about genetics**. Seymour tells a nice story about this as well when Fred Sanger came to Purdue University where Seymour was there to give his insulin lecture. Seymour came up to him and said, 'Oh you're... you come from Cambridge'. He said, 'Do you know Francis Crick?' To which Fred replied, **'Crick? Oh yes, he's the fellow who's rather keen on genes.'** But Francis was not thought to know anything about them even if he was keen on them to warrant being appointed a professor here. > > So we then explored possibilities of going into chemistry. That wouldn't work. Then the MRC said they'd make a building for us. We then tried to get a central site here because in those days in Cambridge you wanted to be in the centre, and it was a very active thing. People were in and out of each other's laboratories, the pubs around in this area were... you could always go in there and meet people from the Molteno Institute to the biochemistry department, so it was... it was like a... it was a real intellectual centre, but we could not actually survive here without getting some expansion. > > And so we tried to find a central site. I think one was found but it was discovered the land didn't belong to them and the university were not very interested in keeping us. And the MRC's first idea was they'll put all the MRC groups together and that will have taken us with certain people we didn't want to have and we told them no. What we think they ought to do is to do something in molecular biology. By this time, I think it was 1958 or 1959, **we had changed the name of our unit – we called it Molecular Biology**.","section":93,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,0,-0.0170672322461873,0,0,0.08533616123093651,0,0.0170672322461873,0,0.0170672322461873,-0.0170672322461873,0.0170672322461873,-0.0170672322461873,0,0,0.08533616123093651,0,0.0682689289847492,0,0,-0.051201696738561904,0.0170672322461873,-0.0341344644923746,0.0170672322461873,-0.051201696738561904,0.5290841996318063,0,0,-0.10240339347712381,0,-0.051201696738561904,0,0,0.3242774126775587,-0.0170672322461873,0.30721018043137144,0,0.0341344644923746,0,0,0,0,0,0.0170672322461873,-0.0170672322461873,0.0170672322461873,-0.0170672322461873,0.0170672322461873,0,0,-0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,-0.0341344644923746,0,0,0,-0.0170672322461873,0.08533616123093651,0,0.0170672322461873,-0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0170672322461873,-0.051201696738561904,0.0170672322461873,-0.0682689289847492,0,0,0.0341344644923746,0,0.0341344644923746,0,0,0,0.0170672322461873,0,0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,0.051201696738561904,-0.051201696738561904,0,0,0,-0.0341344644923746,0.0170672322461873,-0.0682689289847492,0.0341344644923746,-0.08533616123093651,0,-0.0170672322461873,0.0341344644923746,-0.051201696738561904,0,-0.051201696738561904,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0341344644923746,0.051201696738561904,0,0.051201696738561904,0,0.0170672322461873,-0.0341344644923746,0,-0.0682689289847492,0,-0.0170672322461873,0,-0.051201696738561904,0,0,0,0,0,-0.10240339347712381,0,0,0.0341344644923746,-0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,-0.0170672322461873,0.0170672322461873,-0.0170672322461873,0.0682689289847492,-0.0170672322461873,0,-0.0170672322461873,0.0682689289847492,-0.051201696738561904,0,0,0,-0.0170672322461873,0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,0.0341344644923746,0,0,0,0.1877395547080603,0,0.0170672322461873,0,0.0170672322461873,-0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0682689289847492,0,0.2901429481851841,0,0,-0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,0,0.0170672322461873,0,0.0341344644923746,-0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0341344644923746,0,0.0341344644923746,0,0.0341344644923746,0,0.0170672322461873,0,0.0341344644923746,-0.0341344644923746,0,0,0.0170672322461873,-0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,-0.0170672322461873,0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,0,-0.0170672322461873,0,-0.0170672322461873,0,-0.0170672322461873,0.0341344644923746,-0.08533616123093651,0,-0.0341344644923746,0,-0.0170672322461873,0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,0.0170672322461873,-0.0170672322461873,0.0170672322461873,0,0,-0.0341344644923746,0,-0.0341344644923746,0,-0.0170672322461873,0.0170672322461873,0,0.0170672322461873,-0.0341344644923746,0.2901429481851841,0,0,-0.0341344644923746,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0170672322461873,-0.0170672322461873,0,-0.051201696738561904,0,0,0,-0.0170672322461873,0,-0.0170672322461873,0.0170672322461873,-0.051201696738561904,0.0341344644923746,0,0.0682689289847492,0,0,-0.0170672322461873,0,0,0.17067232246187303,-0.0170672322461873,0.0170672322461873,0,0,-0.0341344644923746,0,0,0,-0.0341344644923746,0,0,0.08533616123093651,0,0.0341344644923746,0,0.0341344644923746,-0.0170672322461873,0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.20480678695424762,0,0,0,0,0,-0.051201696738561904,0,0,0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,0.051201696738561904,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0341344644923746,0.0170672322461873,-0.051201696738561904,0.0170672322461873,-0.051201696738561904,0.0341344644923746,0,0,-0.0341344644923746,0,0,0,0,0.0170672322461873,0,0,-0.0170672322461873,0,-0.0170672322461873,0,0,0.0170672322461873,-0.051201696738561904,0.0341344644923746,-0.0170672322461873,0,-0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,-0.0170672322461873,0.051201696738561904,0,0.0682689289847492,0,0,0,0.1194706257233111,-0.0341344644923746,0,-0.0170672322461873,0,0,0.0682689289847492,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0682689289847492,-0.0170672322461873,0,0,0.0170672322461873,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-93-2","text":"> From the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems, and so **that is the kind of first official use of that word** although it had been used before as history has shown – Astbury... we used it some time ago – but in fact this science of molecular biology with its curious combination of chemistry, crystallography and genetics, you know, had been created at that point.

Now, the gene protein problem went ahead, and one of the things we discovered is that the protein that was very easy to purify in very large amounts was the head protein of the bacteriophage. **The amazing thing is that when one studied what happened after infection with this bacteriophage, this single protein accounted for 70% of all the protein synthesis of the cell**. > > Now, what you have to understand is that at that time it was believed that the ribosomes carried the information from the gene to the protein. That is the RNA of the ribosomes was the material that was so to speak the information intermediate. But already a lot of experiments seemed to make that very questionable. > > One of the experiments that created some concern was a whole set of analyses of the RNA of bacteria and of the DNA bacteria and it had been known for some time and strongly reinforced during this period that whereas the base composition – that is the amount of G + C to A + T – varied in bacteria over an enormous range. That is, they were bacteria whose DNA was 3/4 (G + C), down to bacteria whose DNA was 3/4 (A + T). That paradox was accompanied by a complete invariance of the RNA. The RNA seemed to have about the same base composition in all the bacteria. > > This gave rise to a lot of problems because, as you can see, if the DNA is supposed to carry the message, why did it vary so much? You would have thought that the language of the code was pretty invariant. Now there were two kinds of theories to get out of this. One was the DNA of bacteria was made up of two kinds. One was invariant and looked like the DNA—the composition of the RNA; and the other was variable, in fact it was just a lot of junk. Now **the Junk Hypothesis had to be discarded** when Doty and Sueoka showed that the dispersion of the DNA of this base composition was homogeneous. > > That is it was finely dispersed. They did this by measuring the density of the DNA and it's known that the density of G + C is different from the density of A + T. If the Junk Theory was correct you would have expected that DNAs from different bacteria would split into two fractions. One which corresponded to the bulk analysis, and then one smaller fraction which would have been the genes, and what they found is that the DNA base composition of the whole went down to rather small regions of DNA homogeneously. > > So that means that it was there, and of course this gave rise to the concept that in fact the code may be degenerate in some form. In fact Sinsheimer did make a suggestion of this, that essentially the code would have to be a pyrimidine purine code and not depend on which purine or this, so he did make a suggestion of a Binary Code. That of course is wrong, but I mean that is what we had to face. But what we could not explain is why is the base composition of the ribosomes invariant.","section":94,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.03301890873943024,0,0,-0.022012605826286825,0,0,0.011006302913143412,0,0.011006302913143412,-0.011006302913143412,0.011006302913143412,0,0,-0.022012605826286825,0.011006302913143412,0,0.03301890873943024,0,0.03301890873943024,0,0.022012605826286825,-0.011006302913143412,0,-0.04402521165257365,0.011006302913143412,-0.011006302913143412,0.011006302913143412,-0.04402521165257365,0.6603781747886047,0,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,-0.03301890873943024,0.022012605826286825,-0.011006302913143412,0.22012605826286824,0,0.13207563495772096,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03301890873943024,0.011006302913143412,0,0.12106933204457754,0,0.022012605826286825,0,0,0,0,-0.022012605826286825,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,0,0.06603781747886048,0,0.05503151456571706,0,0,0,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,-0.022012605826286825,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,0,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,0,0.05503151456571706,0,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,0,0,0,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,0,0.022012605826286825,0,0,0,0.03301890873943024,0,0.03301890873943024,-0.011006302913143412,0.011006302913143412,0,0.011006302913143412,0,0.011006302913143412,-0.022012605826286825,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0880504233051473,0,0,0.011006302913143412,-0.03301890873943024,0.07704412039200388,-0.022012605826286825,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07704412039200388,0,0,0,-0.03301890873943024,0.07704412039200388,-0.13207563495772096,0,-0.011006302913143412,0.03301890873943024,-0.011006302913143412,0,0,0.022012605826286825,-0.011006302913143412,0,-0.011006302913143412,0.05503151456571706,-0.022012605826286825,0,-0.04402521165257365,0.022012605826286825,0,0,0,0,-0.022012605826286825,0,0,0.03301890873943024,0,0,0,0.011006302913143412,0,0.07704412039200388,0,0,0,0.011006302913143412,-0.03301890873943024,0,-0.022012605826286825,0,0,0,-0.03301890873943024,0,-0.011006302913143412,0.31918278448115894,0,0.011006302913143412,0,0,0,0,0,0.03301890873943024,-0.03301890873943024,0.011006302913143412,0,0,0,0,-0.022012605826286825,0.011006302913143412,0,0.011006302913143412,0,0.011006302913143412,-0.011006302913143412,0.011006302913143412,-0.011006302913143412,0.011006302913143412,0,0,0,0.03301890873943024,0,0.011006302913143412,0,0.011006302913143412,0,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,0,0,0,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,-0.011006302913143412,0.06603781747886048,0,0,-0.011006302913143412,0.022012605826286825,-0.022012605826286825,0,-0.022012605826286825,0,0,0,0,0.011006302913143412,-0.022012605826286825,0,0,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,0,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,0,0,-0.04402521165257365,0.23113236117601166,0,0,-0.03301890873943024,0.011006302913143412,0,0,0,0,0,0.022012605826286825,-0.011006302913143412,0,-0.03301890873943024,0,-0.011006302913143412,0.011006302913143412,-0.022012605826286825,0.011006302913143412,0,0.022012605826286825,0,0.011006302913143412,0,0.022012605826286825,-0.03301890873943024,0.011006302913143412,0,0,0,0.07704412039200388,0,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,-0.15408824078400776,0.022012605826286825,-0.011006302913143412,0,-0.022012605826286825,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,0,0,0,0.011006302913143412,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04402521165257365,0.022012605826286825,0,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,-0.05503151456571706,0,0,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,0,0.09905672621829072,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.011006302913143412,-0.04402521165257365,0,0,0,-0.03301890873943024,0.022012605826286825,-0.022012605826286825,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,0,0,0,0.022012605826286825,0,0,0,0.011006302913143412,-0.022012605826286825,0.011006302913143412,0,0,0,0.04402521165257365,0,0,0,0,0,0.022012605826286825,0,0.011006302913143412,0,0.05503151456571706,0,0.022012605826286825,-0.011006302913143412,0,0,0.38522060196001945,-0.011006302913143412,0,0,0,-0.011006302913143412,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.011006302913143412,-0.05503151456571706,0,-0.06603781747886048,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-95-1","text":"> So if you believe that... and with our work on... on bacteriophage, because of course we started to look at the head protein, and started to look for mutations controlling this, but this business of this prodigious synthesis was something that we knew had to be explained.

If you take bacteria and starve them of magnesium, then after a long period of time – they remain viable – they lose their ribosomes and they destroy them and they turn them over, and that means that when you start 'em up again, by giving them a good medium, they have to take a long time to make new ribosomes to get going. > > So what I said, 'Well, I'll do a quickie'. That's an... that's an experiment which you'll see if you're on the right grounds because if it is true that new ribosomes are made after phage infection, my destroying the old ones wouldn't have any... any effect, and they should just take off and do the same thing. Was absolutely... the experiment was beautifully clear because the fewer the ribosomes that you have as they destroy... so you let... you destroy them, you then infect them at different periods, and you ask how much virus can you make, and it goes down, and it goes down, and there comes a point where you don't make anything because of course after phage infection you don't make any ribosomes. So that said... you know, then I knew I have to be right. > > And then we went to California to do this experiment and that was a hilarious story which has been told by François because you go to do quite a difficult experiment – I mean, it's technically quite complex – and I have to do it in three weeks, and I didn't even know whether it would work, even if we could get it to work. And one of the terrible things is that everything started to fall apart in the density gradient. The ribosomes were not stable and so every experiment failed. These experiments were awful; they took a lot of expensive isotope, and you didn't know the answer until you had run it in a centrifuge for a day, and of course if anything went wrong, if the centrifuge broke down, it was really terrible. So kind of getting this through to the end in an intact form was... was a thing, and every experiment we did didn't work, and I remember people saying, 'Well, you know, you're... it's going to take a year's work of exploratory, you know, normal science, to do this', and one of the amusing things was of course Max Delbrück didn't believe this hypothesis of the unstable intermediate. > > **We called it messenger RNA there, but we had another name for it; we called it Tape RNA** – it was called that for a short while – just being the idea that the ribosomes were like players, you know, like a tape player, and you fed them with tape. Actually, in my mind that was the old Turing machine you see. You fed a tape into this machine and it would play out its results, so it was called tape, and it was the whole idea of a message tape, and that of course strikes one now today as obvious that that would be the analogy. But then it was a very... you know, very dramatic thing, and Max Delbrück... I said to François... I said, 'You know we're fine'. He said, 'Why?' I said, **'Max doesn't believe in it'. Because Max was marvellous; he was always wrong**. > > There are marvellous stories told about Max. George Streisinger tells a story in his... in his essay on Max Delbrück that effectively he was met coming out of Max's office looking very depressed and someone said, 'What's the matter?' He says, **'Max likes my theory; it must be wrong'**. So the whole idea of doing... so I told François, 'Don't bother, Max thinks it's wrong, it must be right, you see', so we had a tremendous episode – this has been told – but one of the interesting things was where do you go from this?","section":99,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.05730118034771075,0,0,-0.01146023606954215,0,-0.0229204721390843,0,0,0.01146023606954215,-0.01146023606954215,0,0,0,-0.0229204721390843,0,-0.01146023606954215,0,0,0.05730118034771075,0,0.1375228328345058,-0.01146023606954215,0.01146023606954215,-0.10314212462587935,0.0229204721390843,0,0.03438070820862645,-0.0229204721390843,0.5844720395466496,0,0,-0.01146023606954215,0,-0.03438070820862645,0.01146023606954215,0,0.17190354104313224,-0.03438070820862645,0.3323468460167224,0,0.01146023606954215,-0.05730118034771075,0,-0.01146023606954215,0,0,0.01146023606954215,-0.0458409442781686,0,-0.03438070820862645,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01146023606954215,0,-0.01146023606954215,0,-0.05730118034771075,0,0,0.0916818885563372,0,0.0229204721390843,0,0.01146023606954215,-0.01146023606954215,0,-0.03438070820862645,0,-0.01146023606954215,0,-0.03438070820862645,0.01146023606954215,-0.01146023606954215,0,0,0,-0.01146023606954215,0.0229204721390843,0,0.14898306890404794,0,0,-0.01146023606954215,0,0,0.01146023606954215,0,0,-0.0229204721390843,0,0,0,-0.0229204721390843,0.05730118034771075,0,0.05730118034771075,-0.08022165248679505,0.01146023606954215,0,0.05730118034771075,-0.01146023606954215,0.01146023606954215,0,0,0,0.01146023606954215,0,0,-0.05730118034771075,0.0687614164172529,0,0,-0.0229204721390843,0.0687614164172529,0,0,-0.03438070820862645,0,-0.0229204721390843,0.0458409442781686,-0.0687614164172529,0,-0.01146023606954215,0,-0.0229204721390843,0.01146023606954215,-0.0916818885563372,0,-0.01146023606954215,0.0229204721390843,0,0,0,0,-0.03438070820862645,0,0,0.0458409442781686,0,0,-0.0458409442781686,0.03438070820862645,-0.01146023606954215,0,-0.03438070820862645,0.01146023606954215,-0.03438070820862645,0.01146023606954215,0,0.10314212462587935,0,0,0,0,0,0.1146023606954215,0,0.0229204721390843,0,0,-0.03438070820862645,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0916818885563372,-0.0229204721390843,0.229204721390843,0,0,0,0,0,0.01146023606954215,0,0.05730118034771075,0,0.0229204721390843,0,0.01146023606954215,0,0,0,0,-0.01146023606954215,0.03438070820862645,0,0.08022165248679505,0,0,-0.01146023606954215,0.01146023606954215,-0.0687614164172529,0,-0.01146023606954215,0.01146023606954215,-0.01146023606954215,0,-0.0229204721390843,0,-0.0229204721390843,0,-0.01146023606954215,0.01146023606954215,0,0.01146023606954215,-0.0229204721390843,0.01146023606954215,-0.01146023606954215,0.03438070820862645,-0.0229204721390843,0,0,0,-0.0687614164172529,0.0229204721390843,-0.0458409442781686,0,-0.05730118034771075,0,0,0,0,0.0229204721390843,-0.01146023606954215,0.01146023606954215,0,0,-0.01146023606954215,0,0,0,-0.01146023606954215,0.0229204721390843,0,0,-0.01146023606954215,0.19482401318221657,0,0,-0.0229204721390843,0.05730118034771075,-0.01146023606954215,0,0,0.0229204721390843,-0.01146023606954215,0.01146023606954215,0,0.0229204721390843,-0.0916818885563372,0,0,0,-0.01146023606954215,0.03438070820862645,0,0.0687614164172529,0,0.03438070820862645,-0.01146023606954215,0.0229204721390843,0,0,-0.0458409442781686,0.05730118034771075,0,0.26358542959946946,-0.03438070820862645,0.0229204721390843,0,0,-0.03438070820862645,0,0,0,-0.1146023606954215,0.01146023606954215,-0.0229204721390843,0.08022165248679505,0,0.0229204721390843,-0.01146023606954215,0.01146023606954215,0,0.01146023606954215,0,0,-0.01146023606954215,0,0,0.0229204721390843,-0.10314212462587935,0.0229204721390843,0,0,0,0,-0.0229204721390843,0,0,0.0229204721390843,0,0,0,0.05730118034771075,-0.01146023606954215,0.01146023606954215,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01146023606954215,0,0,0,-0.0229204721390843,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0229204721390843,0,-0.03438070820862645,0.01146023606954215,-0.01146023606954215,0.03438070820862645,0,0,0,0.0229204721390843,0,0.0458409442781686,0,0.10314212462587935,-0.01146023606954215,0,0,0,0,0.01146023606954215,0,0,0,0.05730118034771075,-0.03438070820862645,0.03438070820862645,-0.05730118034771075,0,0,0.2062842492517587,-0.01146023606954215,0.01146023606954215,0,0,0,0.01146023606954215,0,0,0,0,0,0.01146023606954215,0,0.0687614164172529,-0.01146023606954215,0.0229204721390843,0,0.03438070820862645,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-100-1","text":"> Some of the things I tried then were... were quite interesting, you see. For example, because the caesium chloride we were using to centrifuge these ribosomes was, what we say, 8 molal. That's almost like molar but not quite but you can imagine that it's 8 moles of the salt – that's very, very strong salt – and salt has to be soluble, and of course I discovered that there're bacteria that they'd got out of the Dead Sea that liked to live in 4 molar salt. So we think, why don't we try these, you know, because these will be ribosomes that like a lot of salt, so I actually got them you know, but of course we couldn't have done the experiment because they weren't sensitive to our bacteriophage, and in the end one had to do it with this. > > And the dramatic thing which is recounted is just lying on a beach there because we had gone out to the beach to kind of rest our weary souls; this was the last chance and I had felt... we felt it's all over, you know – we now have to settle down to a year of really boring analysis and conditions and so on; and then it occurred to me that of course, you see, **it is magnesium that stabilises this, and the caesium will compete with the magnesium** – not very efficiently, but enough to displace it and unstabilise it. And of course the magnesium we were putting in was a thousandth molar, the caesium we had was 8 molar; therefore the thing to do is to raise the magnesium. > > And of course I didn't give this argument but as recounted I sprang up and said, 'It's the magnesium, it's the magnesium', and of course, you know, François didn't know what was going on, but he went, and of course we ran back to the lab and we raised the magnesium. We said, 'How much?' I said, 'Let's do a lot', you know because you have three tubes and we said this is the last chance. So I said, 'Put in a lot, can do no harm'. So he said, 'Hundredth molar?' I said, 'All right but let's have one with tenth molar in, you know, we'll just go another 10'. > > So we put this in; we set up the experiment. François was so nervous he dropped the radioactive P-32 in the water-bath, and we hid the water-bath behind the Coca-Cola machine so that they couldn't find it because it was now very radioactive.

Now the mutagenesis thing which was going on simultaneously is quite... is interesting in the sense that at one point Francis decided that he would start to do genetics.","section":102,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0.08326108942436267,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.124891634136544,0,0.04163054471218133,0,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,-0.04163054471218133,0.5411970812583573,0,0,-0.08326108942436267,0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0.29141381298526936,-0.04163054471218133,0.124891634136544,0,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0.08326108942436267,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08326108942436267,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.16652217884872533,0,0,0,0,0.124891634136544,-0.08326108942436267,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0.04163054471218133,-0.08326108942436267,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0.04163054471218133,0,0.04163054471218133,-0.08326108942436267,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.16652217884872533,0,0,0,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04163054471218133,0,0.37467490240963197,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0.08326108942436267,-0.04163054471218133,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08326108942436267,0,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.124891634136544,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0.124891634136544,0,0.04163054471218133,0,0,-0.124891634136544,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.29141381298526936,0,0,0,0,0,-0.20815272356090667,0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0,0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0,0.08326108942436267,-0.08326108942436267,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08326108942436267,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04163054471218133,0,0.16652217884872533,0,0.04163054471218133,0,0,0,0,-0.08326108942436267,0,0,0,0,0.04163054471218133,-0.04163054471218133,0,0,0.04163054471218133,0,0.08326108942436267,0,0,-0.08326108942436267,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-103-1","text":"> Well, we gathered from communication with Matt Meselson that it was a matter of weeks that they would produce their results.

A Turing machine is like a... a kind of a model of a calculating machine in which you have a table that stores information, and a table could be thought of as a piece of tape, and you have another piece of tape on which there are instructions, programs, that say how to go to the tape, what to do when you get to the tape, whether you should put a 0 or a 1 down; and there's one version of the Turing machine which has the instructions on the same tape. And when von Neumann came to look at how cells reproduced themselves, he showed that as far as the automata theory was concerned you needed the description. That is, you couldn't build a machine that could replicate from its own structure; you would require a description of that structure, and you would use the description and you would copy the description and then the new machine with the new description is as good as the old. Okay? And the first thought was, you know, can you dissociate the two of these: this tape recorder – and you can use the tape recorder analogy – in a tape recorder there's a tape, and there's the machinery for reading or writing, and there's an amplifier, right – can we separate these? And in fact the messenger was just an abstraction. It wasn't in the mRNA; it was a concept. Namely that **you could make a machine in which the instructions were separate from the machine**, and that's really what the messenger... I mean, of course it got called messenger RNA. > > And at this meeting at Cold Spring Harbor in 1961, in fact one thing that we discussed was what do we name this thing? And we thought **messenger** was a perfectly good word for it – I don't know who suggested it – but I do recall that Erwin Chargaff immediately said, 'You know, of course, **Mercury may have been the messenger of the gods, but he was also the god of the thieves**'. And I think it's right to steal from nature.","section":105,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.012305420747371317,0,0.012305420747371317,0,0.012305420747371317,0,0.012305420747371317,-0.012305420747371317,0.06152710373685658,0,0.012305420747371317,0,0,-0.0738325244842279,0,-0.012305420747371317,0,0,0,0,0.0738325244842279,0,0.012305420747371317,-0.024610841494742634,0.012305420747371317,-0.012305420747371317,0,0,0.738325244842279,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.024610841494742634,0.1353596282210845,0,0.2953300979369116,0,0.012305420747371317,0,0,0,0,0,0.012305420747371317,-0.012305420747371317,0,0,0.012305420747371317,0,0,-0.012305420747371317,0,0,0.012305420747371317,0,0.012305420747371317,-0.03691626224211395,0,0,0.03691626224211395,-0.024610841494742634,0.024610841494742634,-0.03691626224211395,0,-0.024610841494742634,0.06152710373685658,0,0,-0.012305420747371317,0,-0.012305420747371317,0,0,0.012305420747371317,0,0,0,0.024610841494742634,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.024610841494742634,0,0.012305420747371317,-0.0738325244842279,0.012305420747371317,0,0,-0.03691626224211395,0,0,0.06152710373685658,0,0,0,0.024610841494742634,0,0.012305420747371317,-0.06152710373685658,0,0,0.024610841494742634,-0.012305420747371317,0,-0.04922168298948527,0,-0.012305420747371317,0.03691626224211395,0,0.024610841494742634,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08613794523159922,0,0,0,-0.012305420747371317,0,-0.06152710373685658,0,0,0.09844336597897053,0,0.012305420747371317,-0.012305420747371317,0,0,0,0,0.03691626224211395,0,0.012305420747371317,-0.03691626224211395,0.04922168298948527,0,0,-0.012305420747371317,0,-0.012305420747371317,0.012305420747371317,-0.012305420747371317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1353596282210845,0,0,-0.012305420747371317,0,0,0.012305420747371317,0,0,-0.024610841494742634,0,-0.024610841494742634,0.0738325244842279,0,0.2214975734526837,-0.024610841494742634,0,0,0.012305420747371317,0,0,0,0.03691626224211395,-0.04922168298948527,0.012305420747371317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06152710373685658,0,0.06152710373685658,0,0,0,0,-0.11074878672634185,0,-0.012305420747371317,0.03691626224211395,0,0,-0.012305420747371317,0,-0.012305420747371317,0,-0.012305420747371317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012305420747371317,-0.024610841494742634,0,-0.012305420747371317,0,-0.024610841494742634,0.012305420747371317,-0.0738325244842279,0,-0.06152710373685658,0.012305420747371317,0,0,0,0,-0.06152710373685658,0.012305420747371317,-0.012305420747371317,0,0,0,-0.012305420747371317,0,0,0.09844336597897053,-0.012305420747371317,0.012305420747371317,0,0.1353596282210845,0,0.012305420747371317,-0.03691626224211395,0,0,0,0,0,-0.012305420747371317,0,0,0,0,0.012305420747371317,0,0,-0.012305420747371317,0.012305420747371317,-0.024610841494742634,0.024610841494742634,-0.012305420747371317,0.03691626224211395,-0.012305420747371317,0.012305420747371317,0,0,-0.04922168298948527,0.03691626224211395,-0.012305420747371317,0.12305420747371316,-0.024610841494742634,0,-0.012305420747371317,0.012305420747371317,-0.0738325244842279,0.012305420747371317,-0.012305420747371317,0.024610841494742634,-0.024610841494742634,0,0,0.012305420747371317,-0.012305420747371317,0,0,0,-0.012305420747371317,0,0,0.012305420747371317,0,0,0,0.012305420747371317,-0.04922168298948527,0.012305420747371317,0,0,0,0,-0.04922168298948527,0,0,0.024610841494742634,0,0,0,0.04922168298948527,0,0.012305420747371317,0,0,0,0.012305420747371317,0,0,-0.024610841494742634,0,0,0,-0.024610841494742634,0.024610841494742634,-0.012305420747371317,0.024610841494742634,0,0,0,0.012305420747371317,-0.03691626224211395,0,-0.012305420747371317,0,-0.024610841494742634,0,0,0.03691626224211395,-0.012305420747371317,0.012305420747371317,0,0,0,0.06152710373685658,-0.03691626224211395,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.024610841494742634,0,0.06152710373685658,-0.012305420747371317,0.012305420747371317,-0.024610841494742634,0,0,0.24610841494742633,-0.024610841494742634,0,0,0.012305420747371317,-0.012305420747371317,0.024610841494742634,0,0,-0.012305420747371317,0,0,0.024610841494742634,0,0.06152710373685658,-0.012305420747371317,0.012305420747371317,0,0,-0.03691626224211395,0,-0.024610841494742634,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-106-1","text":"> Of course, at the same time we were doing all of this genetic work and round about then we... Francis had started to play around in the lab with mutants. And his idea was he would look at internal suppressors of these mutants. Now, for example, one thing he proposed to test by this method was the following: that the message was read off the DNA as follows, it went up one chain and then came down the other chain, you see. That would mean, if you got a mutation, it would affect a protein here – OK – but you could compensate for it by mutation in a completely different place. So he was trying to ask whether there was some kind of interaction. > > And his first mutants didn't give him much joy; he started with a few of the base analogue ones. By the way, Dick Feynman started to do similar experiments in Cal Tech, looking for these internal suppressors and probably discovered the same phenomena. Now, where Francis found there were innumerable suppressors was with the acriflavine mutants. So you could start with a mutant, you could get changes that compensated for it, right, and this became now very difficult to explain all this very complex set of relationships, by something that interacted at the protein level – although you couldn't exclude it, say. > > We all knew that it was possible to get a mutation here which would alter a protein and then we would get another mutation elsewhere which corrects it. It's called an internal suppressor. But not with a kind of extent. Now, we also were labouring under this terrible... paradox, and it's always these paradox that, you know, you... you have to keep on coming back... how can... how can these two things exist and not be explained, you know? And of course we all know what I call **Occam's Broom hypothesis, or Occam's Brush in America, which is that hypothesis of which the minimum number of facts have to be swept up under the carpet in order to have a consistent theory**. > > Now, what had happened was that Freese, or Freese I should call him, had given an explanation which was roughly the following: In the DNA we can look at two kinds of changes. One of these we'll call transitions; and that is where we say a purine... one purine goes to the other purine, or, which is equivalent, one pyrimidine goes to the other pyrimidine. So cytosine to thymine is a transition, as is guanine to adenine. And then we talk about transversions, where a purine goes to a pyrimidine, and of course there are two kinds of... several kinds of transversions. > > Well, what Freese had come to the conclusion was the two orthogonal sets of mutants – that is, the set of base analogue mutants which were revertible by base analogues, and the set of now acridine mutants which were not – that one could be transversions and one could be transitions. Right. That was that theory of mutagenesis, as it was called. But if that were the case, you know, we had another paradox all mapped at the same... all mapped at different positions, and you would effectively expect this.","section":106,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.10552897060221725,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09045340337332908,0,0.015075567228888179,-0.015075567228888179,0,-0.04522670168666454,0.030151134457776358,0,0.060302268915552716,0,0.10552897060221725,0,0.1507556722888818,0,0.015075567228888179,-0.060302268915552716,0.0753778361444409,-0.015075567228888179,0.030151134457776358,0,0.5276448530110862,0,0,-0.04522670168666454,0,-0.030151134457776358,0.04522670168666454,0,0.2261335084333227,-0.015075567228888179,0.24120907566221086,0,0,-0.04522670168666454,0,-0.030151134457776358,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.030151134457776358,0,0,0,0,-0.015075567228888179,0,-0.015075567228888179,0,-0.04522670168666454,0,0,0.04522670168666454,-0.015075567228888179,0,-0.015075567228888179,0.060302268915552716,-0.060302268915552716,0,-0.015075567228888179,0,0,0,0,0.030151134457776358,-0.04522670168666454,0,-0.030151134457776358,0,0,0.015075567228888179,0,0.015075567228888179,0,0,0,0.030151134457776358,-0.015075567228888179,0.015075567228888179,0,0,-0.04522670168666454,0,0,0,-0.015075567228888179,0.015075567228888179,-0.030151134457776358,0.12060453783110543,0,0.015075567228888179,-0.015075567228888179,0.030151134457776358,0,0,0,0,-0.030151134457776358,0,-0.015075567228888179,0,-0.10552897060221725,0.015075567228888179,0,0,-0.015075567228888179,0.015075567228888179,-0.04522670168666454,0,-0.015075567228888179,0,-0.015075567228888179,0,-0.04522670168666454,0,0,0,0,0.04522670168666454,-0.10552897060221725,0,-0.030151134457776358,0.04522670168666454,0,0,0,0.015075567228888179,-0.015075567228888179,0,0,0.0753778361444409,0,0,-0.015075567228888179,0.060302268915552716,0,0.030151134457776358,0,0,-0.015075567228888179,0.030151134457776358,0,0,0,0,0,0.015075567228888179,0,0.09045340337332908,0,0,0,0,-0.015075567228888179,0.015075567228888179,0,0.015075567228888179,-0.04522670168666454,0,-0.10552897060221725,0.0753778361444409,0,0.3015113445777636,-0.015075567228888179,0.030151134457776358,0,0,0,0.015075567228888179,0,0.030151134457776358,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.015075567228888179,0.0753778361444409,0,0.04522670168666454,0,0.015075567228888179,-0.030151134457776358,0,0,0,0,0.015075567228888179,0,0.04522670168666454,-0.04522670168666454,0,-0.015075567228888179,0.015075567228888179,-0.030151134457776358,0,0,0,0,0,-0.015075567228888179,0.015075567228888179,-0.04522670168666454,0.060302268915552716,0,0.015075567228888179,0,0.015075567228888179,-0.04522670168666454,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04522670168666454,0.015075567228888179,-0.015075567228888179,0,0,0,-0.015075567228888179,0,0,0,0,0.015075567228888179,-0.030151134457776358,0.18090680674665816,-0.015075567228888179,0,0,0.015075567228888179,0,0,0,0,-0.015075567228888179,0.015075567228888179,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.09045340337332908,0.015075567228888179,0,0.030151134457776358,0,0.10552897060221725,0,0.060302268915552716,0,0,-0.04522670168666454,0,0,0.1507556722888818,0,0.015075567228888179,-0.015075567228888179,0,-0.10552897060221725,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.015075567228888179,0,0.04522670168666454,0,0.04522670168666454,-0.015075567228888179,0.015075567228888179,0,0,0,0.015075567228888179,0,0,-0.16583123951776996,0.09045340337332908,0,0,0,0,-0.060302268915552716,0.015075567228888179,-0.015075567228888179,0,-0.10552897060221725,0.015075567228888179,0,0.060302268915552716,0,0,0,0,-0.015075567228888179,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09045340337332908,0,0,0,0.04522670168666454,0,0,0,0,-0.015075567228888179,0,-0.015075567228888179,0.015075567228888179,0,0.015075567228888179,0,0.015075567228888179,-0.030151134457776358,0,0,0.12060453783110543,0,0,0,0,-0.015075567228888179,0,0,0.030151134457776358,0,0.12060453783110543,-0.015075567228888179,0.04522670168666454,-0.030151134457776358,0,0,0.2864357773488754,-0.0753778361444409,0,-0.015075567228888179,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.060302268915552716,-0.09045340337332908,0.015075567228888179,-0.015075567228888179,0.015075567228888179,0,0.015075567228888179,-0.015075567228888179,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-107-1","text":"> Talking in the Eagle one time, I knew that proflavine... because of my long interest in these damn acridine dyes and their attachment to DNA and all the measurements that had been made in the early '50s by people, though I began to wonder whether in fact there was not another hypothesis.

I mean, sense and nonsense. A very brilliant theory had been produced by Griffith, Crick and Orgel, called **the commaless code**. Now, the commaless code is very interesting. What you do is you take triplets and you say that, 'Can you find a sequence of triplets which can only be read in one frame, so that every other frame is nonsense?' And you can. And you can prove it gives you exactly 20 again. And this again the magic number comes out. So you can write codes called comma-less codes, where in one frame it makes sense, and every other frame it makes nonsense. And so that gives you 20 sense triplets and 44 mis-sense triplets. > > And so one of the things we wanted to know was: how frequently is there nonsense in the code? Because, clearly, if a lot of triplets correspond to no nonsense, you should have very high targets for destroying the meaning of a message. You know, most of the mutations should give you nonsense. And certainly... so... but we needed to get away, and so there was the other thing which was called the... which I called **the Humpty Dumpty model**, which was: how do you get the phase of a message? You start at the beginning and read on in threes till you come to the end; if you remember, that's what Humpty Dumpty tells Alice about how to tell the story and so on. > > And that model then said that if you changed the phase by adding bases or taking out bases you make a mess of the rest of it. All right? And now putting all of those things together made sense. And so we did a very quick experiment which was formulated on that Saturday afternoon; the experiment was actually done on the Monday. What we realised was there are some proteins which are necessary for the phage. These are these host range mutants. And so what we showed, very quickly, was one: all the existing host range mutants were base analogue revertible. Spontaneous host range mutants were base analogue revertible. And that contrasted with the fact that 90% of the spontaneous mutants in the R2 were not base analogue revertible. > > And furthermore: we showed we could induce those mutants with base analogues, but we could not induce them with acridines. And we wrote a paper entitled *The Theory of Mutagenesis*, in which we proposed that there were substitution mutants, for which those were all the ones, and that there were additions and deletions. These were the acridine mutants, producing this drastic effect – and of course now that combined with all these other experiments now made sense.","section":108,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,0,-0.04378745581498246,0,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014595818604994154,0,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0.08757491162996492,0,0.014595818604994154,-0.14595818604994154,0,-0.11676654883995323,0,-0.014595818604994154,0.6568118372247369,0,0,0,0,-0.07297909302497077,0.014595818604994154,-0.014595818604994154,0.07297909302497077,0,0.3648954651248538,0,0,0,0,-0.04378745581498246,0,0,0,-0.014595818604994154,0,-0.029191637209988307,0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0,-0.029191637209988307,0,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0.029191637209988307,0,0,0,0.08757491162996492,-0.014595818604994154,0.029191637209988307,-0.029191637209988307,0,0,0.014595818604994154,-0.029191637209988307,0,0,0,0,0.014595818604994154,-0.029191637209988307,0.08757491162996492,-0.029191637209988307,0.029191637209988307,0,0,0,0,-0.04378745581498246,0,0,0.029191637209988307,-0.014595818604994154,0.014595818604994154,0,0,-0.014595818604994154,0.07297909302497077,-0.014595818604994154,0.11676654883995323,-0.014595818604994154,0.04378745581498246,0,0,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.10217073023495908,0,0,0,-0.029191637209988307,0.04378745581498246,-0.058383274419976615,0,0,0.029191637209988307,0,0,-0.029191637209988307,0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,0,-0.029191637209988307,0,0,0.029191637209988307,0,0,0,0.029191637209988307,0,0,0,0.029191637209988307,0,0,-0.014595818604994154,0.04378745581498246,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08757491162996492,0,0,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,0.058383274419976615,0,0,0,0.08757491162996492,-0.014595818604994154,0.27732055349488893,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.058383274419976615,0,0,0,0,-0.014595818604994154,0,0,0.014595818604994154,-0.029191637209988307,0.029191637209988307,0,0.058383274419976615,-0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.029191637209988307,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0.014595818604994154,-0.04378745581498246,0,0,0,-0.014595818604994154,0,0,0.058383274419976615,0,0.029191637209988307,-0.029191637209988307,0.07297909302497077,0,0,-0.014595818604994154,0.029191637209988307,-0.07297909302497077,0,-0.029191637209988307,0,-0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,-0.08757491162996492,0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0.014595818604994154,-0.029191637209988307,0.1313623674449474,0,0,-0.014595818604994154,0,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.029191637209988307,0,0,0,-0.014595818604994154,0.029191637209988307,0,0.058383274419976615,0,0.08757491162996492,-0.014595818604994154,0.029191637209988307,0,0.014595818604994154,-0.04378745581498246,0,0,0.10217073023495908,0,0,0,0,-0.058383274419976615,0,-0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,0,0.029191637209988307,-0.014595818604994154,0,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,0,-0.1605540046549357,0.04378745581498246,0,0,0,0,-0.08757491162996492,0,0,0.029191637209988307,-0.10217073023495908,0,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0.014595818604994154,-0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,-0.014595818604994154,0.07297909302497077,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.058383274419976615,0,0.029191637209988307,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0.07297909302497077,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0,-0.014595818604994154,0.029191637209988307,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0,-0.014595818604994154,0,-0.014595818604994154,0.20434146046991816,-0.058383274419976615,0,0,0,-0.029191637209988307,0.014595818604994154,0,0,-0.014595818604994154,0,0,0,0,0.014595818604994154,-0.07297909302497077,0.014595818604994154,0,0.014595818604994154,0,0.014595818604994154,-0.014595818604994154,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-109-1","text":"> The acridine experiments went on, and they made various interesting predictions. So just to give you an example, you could start with a mutant which you arbitrarily labelled 'plus', then all the suppressors of it would be ones that would be minuses. So when you add a plus and a minus you come back to zero again. Now, I have to say that this concept of a frame or a phase – we called it phase-shift, it turned to be frame-shift later on – was so foreign to people in genetics that we had endless problems trying to explain this work to people, right? > > And so just going on with this... so now... now you can go... you can start with a suppresser, and it must be symmetrical. So if you start with a minus suppresser, then its suppressors must be plus. And so you then can create arrays of, as they were called, uncles and aunts, cousins, brothers, sisters, and you can see how they relate and you can map them and you can do this. It soon... it became very clear to us very quickly that **we could use this to determine the size of the code**. All we had to ask is how many of these could we put together and so come back to the normal phase, because you see according to this, two pluses would be a minus if it was a triplet phase. > > And so the question was: how do you do this experiment uniquely? And the experiment had to be done uniquely in the following way. You make doubles... you make doubles by brute force. So we take, say, three mutants, A, B, C, in a row, and we make a combination A and B. And A and B is mutant, and we make the combination B and C, and B plus C is mutant. Now, we cross those phages together, there is no way a normal phage can be produced, because they both share B. But of course you get wild-type functional phage come out, and that must be the triple: A, B, C. So we showed we could actually construct a triple, and therefore **the triple showed that the code was phase three**. > > Now, this I think is the kind of apotheosis of a genetic analysis, because you have to consider what you're doing here. You're taking these viruses and you are just mixing them together and you're simply recording plus, minus. And from this pattern it seems mad that you could deduce the actual triplet nature of the genetic code. But that's just simply the logic of how the information is transferred, that it is a non-overlapping code of these, and of course awoke us, well at least awoke me, to the idea that **topology could, you could do these things at the kind of topological level**. > > And so let me just say that to the geneticist this was very hard to stomach. You could take a mutant – you could a set of mutants and you can show first, you could add them in certain pairs, they were still mutant. Other pairs, you just restored the function. Furthermore, you could take these, pair them in many ways, they were still mutant, but if you put three together they came back to normal.

Some of them were very remarkable. For example, there was one mutant which appeared to suppress itself. We could never isolate a suppresser. And it turned out that what that mutant did was duplicate itself, and in the duplication – that is, the junction of the duplication – introduced the third phase shift. So you had plus, you had a junction point which was plus, and then you had the mutant again which was plus. And of course... so we proved this by showing that the mutant mapped on both sides of itself.

And we started experiments here in Cambridge – I had a postdoc who came – and **our idea was to add viral RNAs to E. coli ribosomes because we thought you should be able to play any tape**, and we know that these virus RNAs have information; because they are the genetic information, we could get them in high amounts. > > And so we started with turnip yellow mosaic virus, trying to add it to E. coli ribosomes and trying in an in vitro synthetic system to try to get some protein made, and then our aim was: we'll show them that that's the viral protein. Now when I gave my paper at Cold Spring... at Cold Spring Harbor in '61 – summer of '61 – the people from Ochoa's lab heard this and realised that you could add things to ribosomes. And so they also began adding RNAs to this, and so did Marshall Nirenberg begin by doing this... did this as well. And he started to work with tobacco mosaic virus, trying to add it to E. coli ribosomes. > > Now, of course we know now you won't get anything because these are eukaryotic messengers they require a whole set of factors which are not present in bacteria. The story of adding the... which Ochoa and also Nirenberg did, of adding synthetic polymers, which was the first breakthrough in decoding this. This has various forms. The Ochoa group has claimed they... they realised they could just add this and have a... have a go. They didn't know much about initiation factors and that was good, **that's where ignorance triumphed**. > > And Nirenberg, the story goes, was working with TMV and it was suggested that he use a synthetic polymer as a control to get nothing, you see, because a synthetic polymer of Us would be... would be meaningless. And of course this is where he got a lot of incorporation of phenylalanine. And so a lot of people then began by this and then later by binding experiments, and then Khorana who did a lot of work on this by looking at repeating polymers, so all of that work finally led to the definition of the genetic code by direct analysis through RNAs and ribosomes. > > But I think that those experiments were conceptually implausible until the concept of messenger. No one would have tried it, because you'd have thought: I have to open the ribosome, take out what's there and stick in my thing. And so I think that that was... that was the thing. And indeed, the people in Ochoa's lab said that's what... said that they... they thought that they can do it.","section":113,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.05073825686188038,0,0,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0,0,0.05073825686188038,0,0,0,0.01691275228729346,-0.03382550457458692,0.01691275228729346,-0.03382550457458692,0,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0.10147651372376076,-0.0845637614364673,0.01691275228729346,-0.11838926601105422,0,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0.3382550457458692,0,0,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0.03382550457458692,-0.01691275228729346,0.3382550457458692,-0.01691275228729346,0.43973155946962994,0,0,-0.05073825686188038,0,0,0,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0,-0.01691275228729346,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03382550457458692,0,0,0,0,0.0845637614364673,0,0,-0.01691275228729346,0,0,0.03382550457458692,0,0.03382550457458692,0,0,-0.06765100914917384,0,-0.01691275228729346,0.01691275228729346,0,0,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0,-0.01691275228729346,0,0,0,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0,-0.05073825686188038,0,0,0,-0.01691275228729346,0.05073825686188038,0,0.05073825686188038,-0.05073825686188038,0.05073825686188038,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0,-0.01691275228729346,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03382550457458692,0.01691275228729346,0,0.05073825686188038,-0.05073825686188038,0.0845637614364673,-0.01691275228729346,0.01691275228729346,-0.01691275228729346,0,0,0,-0.11838926601105422,0,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0.03382550457458692,-0.1691275228729346,0,0,0.03382550457458692,0,0,0,0,-0.01691275228729346,0.01691275228729346,-0.05073825686188038,0.03382550457458692,0,0.01691275228729346,-0.03382550457458692,0,0,0,-0.03382550457458692,0,0,0,0,0.10147651372376076,-0.03382550457458692,0,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0.1691275228729346,0,0,-0.01691275228729346,0.01691275228729346,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06765100914917384,0,0.3044295411712823,-0.01691275228729346,0.03382550457458692,-0.01691275228729346,0,-0.01691275228729346,0,0,0.03382550457458692,-0.03382550457458692,0,0,0,-0.01691275228729346,0,0,0,0,0.06765100914917384,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0.05073825686188038,-0.01691275228729346,0.01691275228729346,-0.01691275228729346,0,0,0.06765100914917384,-0.03382550457458692,0,0,0,-0.05073825686188038,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03382550457458692,0,-0.0845637614364673,0.01691275228729346,0,0,-0.0845637614364673,0.01691275228729346,-0.03382550457458692,0,-0.03382550457458692,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01691275228729346,0,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0,-0.01691275228729346,0.01691275228729346,0,0,0,0,-0.01691275228729346,0.13530201829834768,0,0.10147651372376076,-0.01691275228729346,0,0,0.06765100914917384,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0.03382550457458692,-0.01691275228729346,0.03382550457458692,-0.18604027516022806,0,0,0,-0.01691275228729346,0.01691275228729346,0,0,0,0.05073825686188038,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0,0,0,-0.05073825686188038,0.10147651372376076,0,0,-0.05073825686188038,0,-0.01691275228729346,0,0,0,-0.01691275228729346,0,0,0.05073825686188038,0,0.06765100914917384,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05073825686188038,-0.13530201829834768,0.03382550457458692,0,0,0,0,-0.03382550457458692,0,0,0.03382550457458692,-0.01691275228729346,0.03382550457458692,0,0.06765100914917384,0,0,0,0,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0,-0.03382550457458692,0,0,0,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0,-0.01691275228729346,0.05073825686188038,0,0.01691275228729346,-0.03382550457458692,0,-0.01691275228729346,0.01691275228729346,-0.05073825686188038,0,0,0.05073825686188038,0,0,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0.10147651372376076,-0.01691275228729346,0,-0.03382550457458692,0.01691275228729346,0,0.05073825686188038,0,0,0,0.06765100914917384,-0.05073825686188038,0,0,0,0,0.2536912843094019,-0.0845637614364673,0,-0.01691275228729346,0.03382550457458692,0,0.06765100914917384,0,0.01691275228729346,0,0,-0.01691275228729346,0.03382550457458692,0,0.0845637614364673,-0.06765100914917384,0,-0.01691275228729346,0.03382550457458692,-0.03382550457458692,0,-0.01691275228729346,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-114-1","text":"> One of the things that I think was... was bad in... in Britain at the time was our very poor abilities in this kind of biochemistry. All the biochemistry was still very old fashioned, I mean, whereas in America the... the people emerging from the laboratories of Ochoa, from Kornberg... had by this time, you know, the huge armoury of materials. You see, Kornberg had a monopoly, well, you know, I don't want to put it like that, but really he had a monopoly of DNA replication because he was the only person who had radioactive triphosphates. And in fact in the Kornberg-Berg Lab, when a student came in, his first job was to make materials for the research, either prepare an enzyme... so the kind of strategic aspect... I mean, today you just phone up a company and buy it, but in those days getting into the technology and getting that tradition, working on protein synthesis, DNA replication, all of the messenger; there was hardly of this in Europe. And it was something that was very poor. And we realised, you know, coming as we did, that we would have to do some of this. So I think it was effectively, you know, the combination of not being able to get into that fast enough, and in fact we resolved thereafter that we would have... we would develop this biochemistry. I mean, Francis was always very keen to do this, but we didn't have the resources in the Cavendish. But when we moved to the new building we built up a lot of this biochemistry capability. But at the time, you know, we could do things, and in a way it was very good, because doing it by biochemistry just seemed awfully brute force.

Let me give you an example, which is the following: we can look at the head of a virus and we can see it's a perfect icosahedron, right. So... and we know that's genetically determined, because that's inherited. So what we want to know is **how is the equation for an icosahedron written in DNA**. > > Now, many people... we know how the equation for some icosahedron is written, let us say, on the back of cornflakes packages. What you have is you have this and it says cut here, bend here, glue here, and you can fold it all up and make this box. But that's not the way it is done. So what you have to understand is how icosahedra are made. They're not made out of sheets of cardboard inside a cell. What they're made out of is molecules of proteins packing together. And that means that they have certain contacts which have certain angles and those angles are characteristic of the icosahedron. Or the dodecahedron, or whatever it is. > > Now, if you ask how is that angle established, that angle is established because that protein has folded up and displays on its surface a little patch which is able to act, interact with a symmetrical patch on itself, such that they clamp together as a dimer or a trimer or as a pentamer as the case may be. Thus if we were to unravel all of the structure what we will find is that **the equation for an icosahedron is written in little bits and pieces in the genome, in a little sequence of amino acids here, and another little bit there**. And we could not disentangle that a priori unless we understood the principle of construction. > > So the importance of doing molecular structure and of looking at this is to grasp how this is in fact will be encoded in the genome. And to understand that it has enough to have this so you can build virus heads or build organelles or build ribosomes or build membranes or build complexes of any kind like this, because **it's all to do with a process of self-assembly**.","section":116,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.0365697329692419,0,0,0,0,0,0.0365697329692419,0,0.0365697329692419,-0.01828486648462095,0,0,0,-0.054854599453862854,0,0,0.01828486648462095,0,0.12799406539234665,0,0.054854599453862854,-0.01828486648462095,0,-0.09142433242310476,0.0365697329692419,-0.01828486648462095,0,0,0.5485459945386285,0,0,0,0,0,0.01828486648462095,-0.09142433242310476,0.20113353133083045,0,0.23770326430007238,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01828486648462095,-0.01828486648462095,0,0,0.01828486648462095,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01828486648462095,0,0,0,0.054854599453862854,-0.0731394659384838,0.01828486648462095,-0.01828486648462095,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0731394659384838,0,0,0,0,0.054854599453862854,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01828486648462095,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01828486648462095,0.054854599453862854,0,0,0,0.0731394659384838,-0.01828486648462095,0.01828486648462095,-0.0365697329692419,0.01828486648462095,0,0,-0.01828486648462095,0,-0.0731394659384838,0.01828486648462095,-0.0365697329692419,0,0,0.054854599453862854,0,0,0,0,0,0.0365697329692419,-0.12799406539234665,0,0,0,0,0.01828486648462095,-0.10970919890772571,0,0,0.1462789318769676,0,0,0,0,0,0.01828486648462095,0,0.054854599453862854,-0.0731394659384838,0,0,0.054854599453862854,0,0,0,0,0,0.01828486648462095,-0.01828486648462095,0.0365697329692419,0,0,-0.01828486648462095,0,0,0.10970919890772571,0,0,0,0.01828486648462095,0,0,0,0,-0.01828486648462095,0,-0.01828486648462095,0.0731394659384838,-0.054854599453862854,0.2559881307846933,0,0.01828486648462095,-0.01828486648462095,0.01828486648462095,0,0,0,0,-0.01828486648462095,0.0365697329692419,0,0,0,0,0,0.01828486648462095,0,0.01828486648462095,0,0.01828486648462095,-0.0365697329692419,0,0,0.01828486648462095,0,0,0,0,-0.01828486648462095,0.01828486648462095,0,0,-0.0365697329692419,0,-0.01828486648462095,0,0,0.01828486648462095,-0.054854599453862854,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01828486648462095,0,-0.054854599453862854,0,-0.01828486648462095,0.01828486648462095,-0.0365697329692419,0,-0.01828486648462095,0.0365697329692419,0,0,-0.09142433242310476,0,0,0.01828486648462095,-0.01828486648462095,0,0,0,-0.0365697329692419,0,0,0,-0.01828486648462095,0,0,0,-0.01828486648462095,0,-0.01828486648462095,0.01828486648462095,-0.01828486648462095,0,0,0,0,0,-0.09142433242310476,0,0,0.01828486648462095,0,0.01828486648462095,-0.01828486648462095,0.054854599453862854,0,0,-0.01828486648462095,0.054854599453862854,-0.01828486648462095,0,-0.09142433242310476,0,0,0.12799406539234665,0,0.01828486648462095,0,0,-0.32912759672317715,0,0,0.0365697329692419,0,0,0,0.0365697329692419,-0.01828486648462095,0,0,0.0365697329692419,-0.01828486648462095,0,-0.01828486648462095,0,0,0,-0.0365697329692419,0,-0.20113353133083045,0,0,0,0,0,-0.16456379836158858,0,-0.01828486648462095,0.01828486648462095,0,0,0,0.01828486648462095,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0365697329692419,0,-0.01828486648462095,0,-0.054854599453862854,0.054854599453862854,0,0.0365697329692419,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0365697329692419,0,0,0.0365697329692419,0,0,0,0,0,0.01828486648462095,0,0.054854599453862854,-0.0365697329692419,0.01828486648462095,0,0.01828486648462095,0,0.0365697329692419,0,0.01828486648462095,0,0,-0.0365697329692419,0.01828486648462095,-0.054854599453862854,0,0,0.27427299726931426,-0.0365697329692419,0,0,0,0,0.01828486648462095,0,0,-0.01828486648462095,0,0,0,0,0.01828486648462095,-0.0365697329692419,0,-0.01828486648462095,0.0731394659384838,0,0.01828486648462095,-0.01828486648462095,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-117-1","text":"> It gives a lot of people, I should say, a problem. Because when you think about it in even a larger scale, and if you say, 'Well, the behaviour of an organism is specified in the genome; of course we want to... we want to know the whole principle of construction in between'. So when someone says that those little ducks that follow Lorenz around are programmed to follow him around, I mean, we don't think in the DNA it says follow Dr Lorenz around. So what you have to do is you have to have the genes, the genes then have to work in cells, the cells then have to build a nervous system, the nervous system has to have certain capacities for learning, and that's the way the genes specify: follow Dr Lorenz around. So the argument is very clear; **you have to open the box. It is not an input/output system**, because what's in the box can actually determine your theory of how this can work. And I think this is so important in biology and many people think you've got to get your hands on the meat as well as the... as well as, you know, the... the generalisation, and I think that's true; because after all, what we're trying to explain is a very complicated thing. We have a genome here. It's just this very simple array of bases. We have at the other end of it the most elaborate structures, the most... the most bizarre functions of anything, right. We also have a theory that says you can make changes in this and you can affect what it looks like at the other end, and your sense tells you. I don't believe that, because usually if you have something as complicated as this and you make a change in it you just mess it up completely. So we have to have what I call **the grammar of the system**. Part of how you build it up, you construct it, you develop it, is part of that grammar. And unless you include that in the explanation it can't make sense. Hence I think **structure at all levels is important**. > > Francis has a very good statement, he says, 'Function is terribly hard to investigate, so when you can't study function you do the next best thing, which is to study structure'. And I think that this was important although the exact intellectual connection between structural people and people interested in what we were interested in, which is information, and how the information gets out of the genes and how it is used to... to specify all of this, that wasn't as tight a question as it is, because I think that for a long time, even today, structure has been dominated by technical... technical peaks that had to be climbed. And technical accomplishment became very important, so, you know, if you did a molecule of 17,000, then the next time you went on to one of 30,000 – you know, which was eight times as difficult – so that you could expand the boundaries of this. It's... it's to me a most remarkable fact that **the only person that really understands the structure of anything is the person who did that structure**. So if you want to find out about haemoglobin go and talk to Max. Because Max is the only person who really understands haemoglobin. And so I think that... that is now one of the things that this... however, I have to say that it was this genetics, which is I think what we were interested in – and it was protein chemistry, which was what Fred Sanger was interested, together with the structural thing that... that really when put together was all of the future of molecular biology, because what we had were the molecules of information and the molecules of function.","section":117,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.010332916580768917,-0.010332916580768917,0.020665833161537833,0,0.010332916580768917,-0.010332916580768917,0,0,0.03099874974230675,0,0,0,0,-0.09299624922692025,0.020665833161537833,-0.020665833161537833,0.010332916580768917,0,0.03099874974230675,0,0.05166458290384458,-0.010332916580768917,0.010332916580768917,-0.10332916580768917,0,-0.0619974994846135,0.010332916580768917,-0.020665833161537833,0.6923054109115174,0,0,-0.010332916580768917,0,-0.05166458290384458,0,-0.020665833161537833,0.22732416477691617,0,0.19632541503460943,0,0,-0.020665833161537833,0,0,0.010332916580768917,0,0.03099874974230675,-0.03099874974230675,0,-0.041331666323075666,0.020665833161537833,0,0,0,0.010332916580768917,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.041331666323075666,0,0,-0.010332916580768917,0,0,0,-0.010332916580768917,0,-0.020665833161537833,0,-0.041331666323075666,0.010332916580768917,-0.010332916580768917,0,0,0,0,0.020665833161537833,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.10332916580768917,0.020665833161537833,0,0,0,0.020665833161537833,-0.010332916580768917,0.05166458290384458,0,0,0,0.020665833161537833,0,0.020665833161537833,-0.010332916580768917,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03099874974230675,0.03099874974230675,-0.010332916580768917,0,0,0.03099874974230675,-0.020665833161537833,0.010332916580768917,-0.020665833161537833,0,0,0.010332916580768917,-0.15499374871153376,0.010332916580768917,0,0,-0.03099874974230675,0.041331666323075666,-0.11366208238845808,0,0,0,-0.010332916580768917,0,0,0,-0.03099874974230675,0,0,0.05166458290384458,0,0,-0.03099874974230675,0.020665833161537833,-0.010332916580768917,0.010332916580768917,0,0,0,0.010332916580768917,0,0,-0.03099874974230675,0,0,0,-0.010332916580768917,0.1343279155499959,0,0,0,0.010332916580768917,-0.010332916580768917,0,-0.041331666323075666,0,-0.010332916580768917,0,-0.010332916580768917,0.05166458290384458,0,0.2583229145192229,-0.010332916580768917,0,-0.03099874974230675,0.010332916580768917,0,0.010332916580768917,-0.010332916580768917,0.020665833161537833,-0.041331666323075666,0.010332916580768917,-0.010332916580768917,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03099874974230675,0.020665833161537833,0,0,0,0.010332916580768917,0,0.010332916580768917,0,0,-0.010332916580768917,0.010332916580768917,-0.010332916580768917,0,0,0.010332916580768917,-0.010332916580768917,0,0,0,0,0,-0.010332916580768917,0,0,0,-0.010332916580768917,0,-0.010332916580768917,0.020665833161537833,-0.07233041606538242,0.010332916580768917,0,0,-0.041331666323075666,0,0,0,-0.010332916580768917,0,-0.0619974994846135,0,0,0,-0.041331666323075666,0.010332916580768917,0,0,0,0.010332916580768917,0,0.041331666323075666,0,0.08266333264615133,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.010332916580768917,0,0,0.041331666323075666,-0.010332916580768917,0.041331666323075666,0,0.010332916580768917,0,0,-0.041331666323075666,0.020665833161537833,0,0.19632541503460943,0,0.0619974994846135,-0.03099874974230675,0.03099874974230675,-0.17565958187307157,0,0,0,-0.0619974994846135,0,0,0.041331666323075666,0,0,0,0.020665833161537833,0,0.010332916580768917,0,0.010332916580768917,0,0,-0.010332916580768917,0,-0.123994998969227,0.0619974994846135,0,0,0,0,-0.11366208238845808,0.020665833161537833,0,0.08266333264615133,0,0,0,0.010332916580768917,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.010332916580768917,0,-0.020665833161537833,0,-0.010332916580768917,0,-0.020665833161537833,0.041331666323075666,-0.010332916580768917,0.0619974994846135,0,0.041331666323075666,0,0,-0.010332916580768917,0,0,0.010332916580768917,-0.010332916580768917,0.010332916580768917,-0.010332916580768917,0.010332916580768917,0,0.020665833161537833,-0.010332916580768917,0,0,0.020665833161537833,0,0.010332916580768917,0,0,-0.010332916580768917,0,0,0.03099874974230675,-0.010332916580768917,0,-0.03099874974230675,0.03099874974230675,-0.020665833161537833,0,-0.010332916580768917,0.2376570813576851,-0.010332916580768917,0,-0.020665833161537833,0,0,0.0619974994846135,-0.020665833161537833,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03099874974230675,-0.03099874974230675,0.010332916580768917,0,0,0,0,0,0.020665833161537833,0]},{"id":"transcript-118-1","text":"> 1961 was of course a very exciting year. During that year we published two papers. One was on the messenger RNA experiments, and the other was on the general nature of the genetic code. Of course, that was incredibly exciting, but there was still a lot more work to do in order to follow these things up. But already I think in 1962, my interests were already turning to different matters. And during that year Francis Crick and I began a long series of conversations, which we continued over several years, which is: **what should we do next?** > > It seemed, as it does happen in all science, that when one gets to this stage there seem to be only what the military people call mopping up operations. And of course such was the thrill of doing molecular biology that one didn't want to be involved in that, and one would rather go forward to fresh pastures. > > I had during 1961, had a number of discussions with François Jacob – who was... who did the messenger RNA experiments with me – about DNA replication. And we did some experiments together in early 1962 which tried to test the model that we proposed. This was called the replicon. > > In those days everybody defined a unit in the same way physicists defined units, and the first person to do that was Seymour Benzer. Seymour Benzer defined three units: the **cistron**, which was the unit of complementation; the **muton**, which was the unit of mutation; and the **recon**, which was the unit of recombination. And of course only one of those has survived, the cistron, and the reason the other two didn't survive was that **one should always see what one's units sound like in a different language**. And since we had numerous French colleagues, the other two didn't survive because one sounded like a sheep, and the other one sounded like the things Paris taxi drivers call each other. So those two got eliminated. > > Some... a short while thereafter, and I think it was 1957 or 1958, I invented the word **codon**, which was... which has also survived. And that was a word to describe the... the units that would be... would be... specify the amino acids, which of course we used that because we didn't know at the time that they were triplets.

Bacteria had elements called F elements. These F elements could transfer themselves by so-called process of conjugation from one bacterium to another. That was work that had done by Bill Hayes and of course extensively by Jacob and Wollman in their study of bacterial conjugation, and they proved that the chromosome – when it was attached to an F element in the so-called Hfr strains, high frequency of recombination – were transferred from one point in one given direction, and progressively, so that it would take about two hours, 120 minutes, to transfer the whole chromosome. And we thought that the good driving force for this – this was the replicon idea – was of course replication itself. So our idea was that a bacterial cell carrying an F element had two replicons: its own and one of the F element. The F element was a rather special one in that it started from a point of origin and then by replication it would drive the chromosome across the cell, because you can either think of the DNA polymerase sitting in one place... you can either think of the DNA polymerase moving along the DNA, but if you were to nail it down what would happen is the DNA would pass through it. Which is of course a much better picture of what's going on. And if it did this it would transfer a daughter chromosome. > > Now, what we knew is that acridine orange cured F factors. That is, if you grew cells carrying F factors in acridine orange they lost them. We therefore argued for some reason or another the F factor was sensitive, its replication was sensitive to this dye, acridine orange. Therefore, we said, if transfer was due to the same replication experiment we should be able to stop transfer by acridine orange. However, there was no sign that acridine orange actually inhibited replication, and so our argument was that once it got started you couldn't stop it with acridine orange. You could only stop its initiation. And of course we did the experiments, they were very simple to do and they worked immediately. > > Well, François and I discussed this is the... in spring of 1962, we discussed this at a meeting at Royaumont and we both went home and we both did the experiment the next day and we phoned each other up to tell us, to tell each other that we'd got the same results. So we then proceeded to do more experiments, and in fact we planned a rather complicated experiment and... but decided that since the theory was so good we would write it up in advance. And we went on a combined family holiday to a French seaside resort called La Tranche which we used to... we still do refer to as **Zee Slice**, in the Vendée, and we spent hours on the beach sort of telling children not to pester us, and in that we developed the whole idea of the replicon. Which we published later that year in the *Comptes Rendus* and that was the theory of... and we proceeded then to do a number of experiments to test it.","section":120,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.014347335194093556,0,0.014347335194093556,0,0,-0.014347335194093556,0,0,0.028694670388187113,-0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,-0.028694670388187113,0.014347335194093556,0,0,-0.014347335194093556,0.04304200558228067,0,0.18651535752321624,-0.028694670388187113,0,-0.10043134635865489,0.014347335194093556,0,0.04304200558228067,-0.014347335194093556,0.48780939659918093,0,0,-0.014347335194093556,0,-0.04304200558228067,0.028694670388187113,0,0.25825203349368403,0,0.3299887094641518,0,0.028694670388187113,-0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,0,0.04304200558228067,-0.014347335194093556,0,0,0.057389340776374226,0,0.028694670388187113,-0.014347335194093556,0.014347335194093556,0,0,-0.04304200558228067,0.014347335194093556,-0.04304200558228067,0,0,0.057389340776374226,-0.014347335194093556,0,-0.04304200558228067,0,0,0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,-0.014347335194093556,0.04304200558228067,-0.028694670388187113,0.057389340776374226,0,0,0,0,0,0.028694670388187113,0,0,-0.04304200558228067,0.014347335194093556,0,0.014347335194093556,0,0.04304200558228067,0,0.04304200558228067,-0.014347335194093556,0,-0.057389340776374226,0.028694670388187113,-0.014347335194093556,0.014347335194093556,0,0.028694670388187113,-0.08608401116456134,0,-0.014347335194093556,0,-0.10043134635865489,0,0,0.014347335194093556,-0.04304200558228067,0.028694670388187113,-0.04304200558228067,0,-0.04304200558228067,0,0,0.014347335194093556,0,0.014347335194093556,-0.014347335194093556,0,-0.028694670388187113,0,-0.10043134635865489,0,0,0.028694670388187113,0,0.07173667597046779,-0.014347335194093556,0,-0.014347335194093556,0.028694670388187113,0,0.028694670388187113,0,0,0,0.028694670388187113,-0.028694670388187113,0,0,0,-0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014347335194093556,0.17216802232912268,0,0,0,0.028694670388187113,-0.028694670388187113,0.014347335194093556,0,0,-0.028694670388187113,0,-0.028694670388187113,0.014347335194093556,0,0.27259936868777757,-0.028694670388187113,0,0,0.028694670388187113,0,0,0,0.014347335194093556,-0.10043134635865489,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.028694670388187113,0,0.028694670388187113,0,0.057389340776374226,-0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.028694670388187113,0,0,0,0.04304200558228067,0,0,-0.028694670388187113,0,-0.028694670388187113,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014347335194093556,0,-0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,-0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,-0.028694670388187113,0.08608401116456134,-0.014347335194093556,0,-0.07173667597046779,0,0,0.014347335194093556,-0.014347335194093556,0.014347335194093556,0,0.014347335194093556,-0.014347335194093556,0.20086269271730978,0,0,-0.07173667597046779,0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,0.014347335194093556,-0.014347335194093556,0.014347335194093556,0,0,-0.057389340776374226,0,0,0,-0.014347335194093556,0.028694670388187113,-0.028694670388187113,0.057389340776374226,0,0.04304200558228067,-0.014347335194093556,0.014347335194093556,0,0,-0.014347335194093556,0.014347335194093556,-0.014347335194093556,0.17216802232912268,-0.014347335194093556,0.014347335194093556,0,0.028694670388187113,-0.07173667597046779,0,-0.014347335194093556,0,-0.028694670388187113,0,0,0.028694670388187113,-0.014347335194093556,0.028694670388187113,0,0.04304200558228067,-0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,-0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,-0.31564137427005823,0.014347335194093556,-0.014347335194093556,0,-0.014347335194093556,0,-0.04304200558228067,0,0,0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,0.014347335194093556,0,0,-0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,0,0.014347335194093556,-0.028694670388187113,0,0,0.014347335194093556,0,0.014347335194093556,0,0,-0.028694670388187113,0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,0,-0.014347335194093556,0,-0.028694670388187113,0,0,0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,0.014347335194093556,0,0.08608401116456134,-0.07173667597046779,0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08608401116456134,-0.014347335194093556,0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,0.25825203349368403,-0.014347335194093556,0.014347335194093556,0,0.014347335194093556,0,0.014347335194093556,0,0,-0.014347335194093556,0,0,0,0,0.04304200558228067,-0.08608401116456134,0,0,0.028694670388187113,0,0.014347335194093556,-0.028694670388187113,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-121-1","text":"> One of the important experiments which was very tricky to do was of course to show – in addition to all the things we had done with F factors – that it... that the DNA transferred from the male into the female bacterium was of course one-time replicated. This we proposed to do by a Meselson-Stahl experiments. Meselson and Stahl had labelled DNA with heavy atoms, nitrogen and carbon. And they had shown then that DNA replicated semi-conservatively – that is, the daughter molecules had one old strand, for example, light, and the new, and the new molecules had a heavy strand. > > So we proposed to use this. This was extremely difficult experiment to do at the time, because you had to have many labels radioactive to mark the parental DNA. It had to be done... we had to make sure that we destroyed all unconjugated cells, and that we only retrieved DNA from the cells. And eventually they were such a minority of the population. However, the experiment was done and in fact did show that the DNA that came across was indeed a hybrid DNA, had been replicated once. > > One of the other features of, of our experiment was that in somehow the DNA had to be attached to some part of the cell, and in bacteria that have no nucleus, no nuclear membrane, this DNA had to be attached to the cell membrane. And the idea was that if it was attached at a given point, which is another part, only one point would be required for the attachment, then when it copied, the new copy would be attached, remain attached by one strand. And then the idea was you would grow the membrane in between the two copies and that's the way they segregated to opposite cells. > > I have to say that in doing this work there, I had an echo of something I had done ten years previously, or more, in South Africa, where I had been using little pieces of liver in a Beams and King turbine ultracentrifuge, an air turbine which I'd built myself. And I noticed in centrifuging these cells and cutting sections of them, that the... that the DNA, or as we called it then, chromatin, had not sedimented completely to the bottom of the nucleus, but seemed to be connected to the top of it by strands. And in fact I was so impressed by this that I thought that that proved that, that the chromosomes were still attached to the nuclear membrane. And I wrote a paper on this which was published in *Experimental Cell Research* in 1953, called *The Chromatic Nuclear Membrane*, which was the result of that experiment and which showed DNA attached to this. And of course in the last few years this has now come back again and DNA seems to have in higher organisms some attachment to the cells.","section":121,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.08441499118250291,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.028138330394167636,0,0.014069165197083818,0,0,-0.014069165197083818,0,0,0.014069165197083818,-0.028138330394167636,0.21103747795625727,0,0.11255332157667054,0,0.014069165197083818,-0.028138330394167636,0,-0.014069165197083818,0.028138330394167636,0,0.5346282774891851,0,0,0,0.014069165197083818,-0.014069165197083818,0.014069165197083818,0,0.35172912992709543,0,0.2813833039416764,-0.014069165197083818,0,-0.028138330394167636,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014069165197083818,0,0,0.18289914756208964,0,0,0,0.014069165197083818,0,0,-0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,-0.028138330394167636,0.014069165197083818,-0.014069165197083818,0.028138330394167636,-0.014069165197083818,0.014069165197083818,-0.028138330394167636,0.028138330394167636,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.028138330394167636,0.014069165197083818,0,0,-0.014069165197083818,0.028138330394167636,0,0.05627666078833527,0,0,0,0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.028138330394167636,-0.014069165197083818,0.08441499118250291,-0.014069165197083818,0,0,0.028138330394167636,0,0.028138330394167636,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08441499118250291,0,0,0.014069165197083818,-0.028138330394167636,0,-0.014069165197083818,0,-0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,-0.05627666078833527,0,0,0,0,0,-0.12662248677375437,0.014069165197083818,-0.014069165197083818,0.028138330394167636,0,0,0,0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,0.028138330394167636,-0.028138330394167636,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.042207495591251455,0.19696831275917345,0,0.014069165197083818,-0.042207495591251455,0.014069165197083818,-0.028138330394167636,0,-0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,-0.014069165197083818,0,-0.014069165197083818,0.33765996473001164,0,0,-0.014069165197083818,0,0,0.014069165197083818,0,0.014069165197083818,-0.1406916519708382,0,0,0.014069165197083818,-0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1406916519708382,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014069165197083818,0.014069165197083818,0,0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,0,0,0.014069165197083818,-0.014069165197083818,0,0,0.042207495591251455,0,0.014069165197083818,-0.014069165197083818,0,0,0.014069165197083818,-0.014069165197083818,0,-0.028138330394167636,0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014069165197083818,0,-0.014069165197083818,0.014069165197083818,-0.042207495591251455,0,-0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,0,0,-0.028138330394167636,0.18289914756208964,-0.014069165197083818,0,-0.028138330394167636,0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,0.014069165197083818,-0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,-0.042207495591251455,0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,0.028138330394167636,0,0.014069165197083818,-0.014069165197083818,0.014069165197083818,-0.014069165197083818,0.014069165197083818,0,0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,0.08441499118250291,-0.042207495591251455,0.028138330394167636,0,0.028138330394167636,-0.028138330394167636,0.014069165197083818,-0.014069165197083818,0,-0.028138330394167636,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014069165197083818,-0.014069165197083818,0,-0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,0,0,-0.09848415637958673,0.014069165197083818,0,0,-0.028138330394167636,0.014069165197083818,-0.028138330394167636,0,-0.028138330394167636,0.08441499118250291,0,0,0,0.028138330394167636,0,0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,0.05627666078833527,-0.014069165197083818,0,-0.028138330394167636,0,0,0,-0.042207495591251455,0.028138330394167636,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014069165197083818,-0.014069165197083818,0.014069165197083818,-0.028138330394167636,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014069165197083818,0,0.05627666078833527,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014069165197083818,0,0.0703458259854191,-0.028138330394167636,0.05627666078833527,0,0,0,0.21103747795625727,-0.042207495591251455,0,-0.028138330394167636,0,-0.014069165197083818,0.014069165197083818,-0.014069165197083818,0,-0.05627666078833527,0,0,0.014069165197083818,0,0.05627666078833527,-0.042207495591251455,0,-0.014069165197083818,0.028138330394167636,-0.014069165197083818,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-122-1","text":"> These experiments with François continued throughout 1962, and in that year we also got the idea that we would study DNA replication in some depth. And the way to do this we thought was to go and isolate temperature-sensitive mutants of replication. And so in that year I started a rather large project together with François to look for temperature-sensitive mutants of E. coli, which we did and we developed many, many ways of doing this, very quickly. > > And amongst these we found quite a number that were defective in DNA replication, because of course we wanted mutational evidence for our model. And if we... if, as we had predicted, there would be a positive element that would be required to start DNA replication, then a mutant of that, we argued, would not allow a bacterium actually to start DNA replication and therefore these bacteria should be blocked at start in this cycle of replication. > > Well, that work developed on quite a large scale, and many of the mutants we used, we isolated, later became very famous. In fact, it wasn't just one gene making an enzyme that was required for DNA replication, but indeed, the mutation certainly got as far as **DNA-Z, which means that there were at least 26 of these**. And some of the early ones... DNA-A which is the name of one of the elements involved in initiating DNA replication... it was of course the first one characterised, and DNA-B, which helps as well to do this, and C and D and so on. > > We had started with collaborators to... in... in the Pasteur Institute to characterise these mutants, and to show that some of them were involved in initiation, so that once the chromosome initiated it would go on and... and complete, and others were involved of course in the act of replication itself. And later those mutants were used with great effect by other people to identify the new genes, and by using extracts of these mutants and complementing them, many, many new functions were biochemically purified. So that new polymerases were discovered; in fact two new polymerases were discovered. A large number of cofactors that these required were identified and purified.

While we were working in this I had started to isolate a number of mutants in bacteriophage T4 called minutes. I worked extensively on these minutes during 1960 when I could show that there were lots and lots of different ones. And they were difficult to work with, but we did in fact map quite a large number of ones. I didn't have the sense to see that these were just leaky mutants – that is, almost conditional, almost lethals.

In fact when people said, 'Why don't... why do you want to work on the nervous system; why don't you choose something simpler first, like the big toe or something like that?' I said that I worked on the nervous system because it became absolutely clear from that that no simple hypothesis would account for what there is. Because there the great... at that time the great fear is that everything would finally be explicable by beta-galactosidase, by Jacob-Monod theories on... that there'd be a repressor, you take off the repressor, this thing would be induced and that's the way you get it. And what we wanted is to get to a problem which was so difficult that in fact it wouldn't be so easily explained. And **the nervous system offered this possibility simply because everything... not only did you have to have cells, not only did you have to have cells in the right place, but they actually had to wire up together accurately**. And it is the wiring problem of the nervous system, where things grow for very long distance and hook up at the end of the day, at the end of their journeys with the right cell target, that seemed that you would need very special explanations, for that could not be accounted for in simple terms, and therefore this is really what one wanted to know. > > Well, one of the discussions we had during this time was in fact whether we try and decompose this into a set of subsidiary problems and tackle each one. So there'll be problems of how cells move – that clearly happens in higher organisms, cells move around. There'd be problems of how cells grow, there'd be problems of the polarity of cells in the sense that cells go in one direction and not in another, grow in one direction, or face the world from one side of themselves and not the other. So how was all of this polarity established? And then of course there were whole questions of how you turned on all the different genes in a cell that distinguishes, let us say, a neurone from a liver cell. How did you, how did things get to be that? And so maybe differentiation could be studied, in... separately from development, taken out of the context of development and attacked in a... in a higher cell. And so I began to look around for examples which because of a favourable biological history of that species might show this in some exaggerated or isolated form. That has been something I've always done, because I think such is the diversity of, of living forms that **you can always find a special case that aids you with your experiments**. And there were classic examples of this; acetabularia – which is an alga – was so big you could actually suck out the contents of the cell and analyse them. And you felt certain you were looking at the same kind of process. So where could one find cases in which the exemplar would be such that it would show the same process – that is, it had to be essentially the same process that you found inside a living organism, and that enabled you to investigate it more readily.","section":127,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.14778818248783557,0,0.024631363747972593,0,0,0,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0.04926272749594519,0,0,0,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0.012315681873986297,0,0,0,0.03694704562195889,0,0.07389409124391778,0,0,-0.09852545499189037,0.012315681873986297,-0.024631363747972593,0.012315681873986297,0,0.6157840936993149,0,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0.012315681873986297,-0.024631363747972593,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0.16010386436182186,-0.012315681873986297,0.23399795560573963,0,0.024631363747972593,-0.012315681873986297,0,-0.024631363747972593,0.012315681873986297,0,0.012315681873986297,0,0,0,0,0,0.012315681873986297,0,0.012315681873986297,0,0.024631363747972593,-0.06157840936993148,0,-0.03694704562195889,0,0,0.04926272749594519,0,0,-0.012315681873986297,0,-0.012315681873986297,0,0,0.012315681873986297,-0.024631363747972593,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0.012315681873986297,0,0,0,0,0,0.06157840936993148,0,0,-0.012315681873986297,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.012315681873986297,0.024631363747972593,0,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0.024631363747972593,0,0.04926272749594519,-0.012315681873986297,0,0,0.024631363747972593,-0.024631363747972593,0,-0.012315681873986297,0.024631363747972593,0,0,-0.012315681873986297,0.024631363747972593,-0.08620977311790408,0,-0.012315681873986297,0,-0.012315681873986297,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0,-0.012315681873986297,0,-0.012315681873986297,0.012315681873986297,-0.04926272749594519,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0,-0.024631363747972593,0,-0.09852545499189037,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0.04926272749594519,0,0,0,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0.03694704562195889,-0.012315681873986297,0.024631363747972593,-0.012315681873986297,0.06157840936993148,0,0,-0.024631363747972593,0,0,0.04926272749594519,0,0,0,0.012315681873986297,0,0.012315681873986297,0,0.19705090998378075,0,0.024631363747972593,0,0,-0.024631363747972593,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0.3571547743456026,0,0,-0.024631363747972593,0.03694704562195889,0,0,-0.012315681873986297,0.06157840936993148,-0.06157840936993148,0.024631363747972593,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06157840936993148,0.06157840936993148,0,0,0,0,0,0.024631363747972593,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012315681873986297,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.012315681873986297,0,0,0,-0.03694704562195889,0,0,0.03694704562195889,-0.07389409124391778,0.012315681873986297,-0.09852545499189037,0.024631363747972593,-0.024631363747972593,0,-0.012315681873986297,0.012315681873986297,0,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0,0,0,0,0,-0.012315681873986297,0,0,0,-0.012315681873986297,0.07389409124391778,0,0,-0.04926272749594519,0,0,0,0,0,-0.012315681873986297,0,-0.04926272749594519,0,-0.012315681873986297,0.012315681873986297,0,0,-0.012315681873986297,0,0,0,0,0.012315681873986297,0,0.07389409124391778,0,0,-0.09852545499189037,0.024631363747972593,0,0.08620977311790408,0,0,0,0,-0.09852545499189037,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0,0,0.08620977311790408,0,0,0,0.024631363747972593,-0.012315681873986297,0.012315681873986297,0,0,0,0.012315681873986297,0,0.012315681873986297,-0.04926272749594519,0.03694704562195889,0,0.012315681873986297,0,0,-0.06157840936993148,0.012315681873986297,-0.012315681873986297,0.09852545499189037,0,0,0,0.012315681873986297,0,0,0,0,0,0.024631363747972593,0,0,-0.04926272749594519,0.012315681873986297,-0.024631363747972593,0,-0.012315681873986297,0.06157840936993148,0,0,0,0,-0.024631363747972593,0,-0.024631363747972593,0,-0.012315681873986297,0.024631363747972593,0,0,0,0,-0.012315681873986297,0,0,0.012315681873986297,0,0.04926272749594519,-0.024631363747972593,0.024631363747972593,0,0.024631363747972593,0,0,0,0.012315681873986297,0,0.08620977311790408,-0.012315681873986297,0.06157840936993148,-0.024631363747972593,0,0,0.3448390924716163,-0.03694704562195889,0.06157840936993148,-0.03694704562195889,0,0,0.04926272749594519,0,0,-0.012315681873986297,0,0,0,0,0.012315681873986297,-0.03694704562195889,0,0,0.06157840936993148,0,0.012315681873986297,0,0.024631363747972593,-0.012315681873986297]},{"id":"transcript-128-1","text":"> I was ill one day and I asked my wife to get me a book which I'd phoned up Heffer's, the booksellers in Cambridge, which was on protozoa.

And the whole sort of conceptual layout was very clear in my mind before even starting – that what one would do is effectively get all the genes that fix the wiring diagram and then work out what they do.","section":130,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.022857516044124723,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,0.045715032088249445,0,0,0,0,-0.045715032088249445,0,0,0,0,0.16000261230887305,0,0.11428758022062362,0,0,-0.09143006417649889,0.022857516044124723,-0.06857254813237416,0,0,0.6171529331913675,0,0,-0.045715032088249445,0,-0.045715032088249445,0,0,0.16000261230887305,0,0.27429019252949666,0,0,0,0,-0.045715032088249445,0,0,0.022857516044124723,-0.022857516044124723,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,0,0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.045715032088249445,0,-0.022857516044124723,0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.045715032088249445,0,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.022857516044124723,0,0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0.022857516044124723,0,0.045715032088249445,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0.045715032088249445,0,0,-0.045715032088249445,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06857254813237416,0,0,0,-0.045715032088249445,0.022857516044124723,-0.022857516044124723,0,-0.045715032088249445,0.045715032088249445,-0.022857516044124723,0,-0.06857254813237416,0,0,0,0,0,-0.045715032088249445,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,-0.045715032088249445,0,-0.022857516044124723,0.045715032088249445,-0.022857516044124723,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,0,0.045715032088249445,0,0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,0,0.18286012835299778,0,0.045715032088249445,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2971477085736214,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11428758022062362,0.045715032088249445,0,0,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,-0.045715032088249445,0.09143006417649889,0,0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,-0.045715032088249445,0,-0.045715032088249445,0,0,0,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,0,0.045715032088249445,-0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,0,0.022857516044124723,-0.022857516044124723,0.09143006417649889,0,0,-0.06857254813237416,0,0,0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,0,0.022857516044124723,-0.11428758022062362,0,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0.022857516044124723,0,0.13714509626474833,0,0.06857254813237416,-0.022857516044124723,0.022857516044124723,0,0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0.13714509626474833,0,0,0,0.022857516044124723,-0.13714509626474833,0,0,0,-0.045715032088249445,0.022857516044124723,0,0.06857254813237416,0,0.022857516044124723,0,0.045715032088249445,0,0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0.045715032088249445,0,0,-0.06857254813237416,0.045715032088249445,0,0,0,0,-0.06857254813237416,0.022857516044124723,0,0.09143006417649889,0,0.045715032088249445,0,0.18286012835299778,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.045715032088249445,0,-0.045715032088249445,0.09143006417649889,0,0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,0,0.022857516044124723,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0.022857516044124723,0,0.06857254813237416,-0.045715032088249445,0,0,0,0,0.022857516044124723,-0.06857254813237416,0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0.045715032088249445,0,0.045715032088249445,-0.045715032088249445,0,-0.045715032088249445,0,0,0.2057176443971225,-0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,0.045715032088249445,-0.045715032088249445,0,-0.022857516044124723,0.022857516044124723,0,0,0,0,-0.022857516044124723]},{"id":"transcript-131-1","text":"> My good friend and colleague Seymour Benzer had also decided to drop phage and go into this.

And the two steps I defined in a paper, which I wrote at the time, much later, but they had been defined earlier, and that is you ask the question: **how do you build nervous systems?** That's one question, and that's what the genes do. And then you ask: **how do these nervous systems work to generate behaviour?** And the important idea there is exactly the one that we had in molecular biology. You can't understand how this... how the gene corresponds to the phenotype without understanding the paradigm of construction between them, the construction paradigm. Once you understand that phage is put together by molecules into sub-assemblies and these sub-assemblies are glued together to make a phage, you can then understand how the gene, the genetic, the genes correspond to this geometrical structure. And so the same must be true of these higher organisms. And that you then separate the construction issue, the developmental issue, the building issue, from that of function, and the two are then interlocked, because clearly what organisms do is an output from the machines they have to do things with. What machines they have to do things is an output of their genes. > > So I think that made a clarification and showed that from a genetic point of view the most important question, at least for me, was: **how do genes build nervous systems?** And that is why I have... I just could not understand how all these people that have this endless argument in the field of behavioural genetics, which was very popular in the early '60s. And there were arguments about genes and intelligence, for example, which aroused tremendous anger of people saying it's just impossible that genes specify intelligence. And what you'd have to do, according to my view, is you'd have to show what is the machine inside the organism that generates intelligence and how do genes affect it? And until you have satisfied that... so that means you have to understand how people display intelligence, and that's one issue, and then you can go to the genes, and of course genes will affect it in the sense that they... they are needed to build your brain – you can't get rid of them, because if you don't have any genes you don't exist, so in that sense you have to do this. And that just means it's not a question of philosophy or belief or any... it's just a question of what it is. > > And of course you can see that the whole constraint of this is everything has had to be produced by evolution. Intelligence has had to be produced by evolution. Presumably unintelligent people in the early days didn't survive; they couldn't cope with the environment so they were eliminated. And once everything comes to us through this sieve, through this filter, and that filter has to work with genes, then you can see how all of these things are interrelated. And the one thing we can do in a laboratory is to dissect these... separate all these issues and define them in this way. The nematode seemed to be the best way of doing this, and I therefore started what is now known as **the C. elegans Project**.","section":132,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.04804999801042981,0,0.024024999005214907,0,0.024024999005214907,0,0,-0.012012499502607453,0.024024999005214907,0,0.012012499502607453,0,0,-0.012012499502607453,0,0,0.012012499502607453,0,0.07207499701564472,-0.012012499502607453,0.1801874925391118,0,0,-0.060062497513037265,0,-0.15616249353389688,0.012012499502607453,0,0.6486749731408025,0,0.024024999005214907,-0.012012499502607453,0,-0.012012499502607453,0,-0.03603749850782236,0.22823749054954162,0,0.31232498706779377,-0.024024999005214907,0,-0.012012499502607453,0,-0.012012499502607453,0,0,0,-0.012012499502607453,0.012012499502607453,0,0,0,0,0,0.024024999005214907,0,0,-0.012012499502607453,0,-0.012012499502607453,0,-0.03603749850782236,0.012012499502607453,0,0,-0.012012499502607453,0,0,0.024024999005214907,-0.060062497513037265,0,0,0,-0.024024999005214907,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.024024999005214907,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.012012499502607453,0.012012499502607453,0,0.012012499502607453,-0.012012499502607453,0,0,0,-0.024024999005214907,0.024024999005214907,-0.012012499502607453,0.03603749850782236,-0.04804999801042981,0,0,0.024024999005214907,-0.024024999005214907,0,0,0,-0.012012499502607453,0,0,0,-0.04804999801042981,0.024024999005214907,0,0.012012499502607453,-0.024024999005214907,0.012012499502607453,-0.012012499502607453,0,-0.03603749850782236,0,-0.012012499502607453,0.012012499502607453,-0.12012499502607453,0,-0.012012499502607453,0,0,0,-0.12012499502607453,0,0,0.024024999005214907,0,0,0,0.012012499502607453,0,0,0,0.060062497513037265,-0.012012499502607453,0,-0.012012499502607453,0.03603749850782236,-0.012012499502607453,0,-0.012012499502607453,0.012012499502607453,0,0,0,0.012012499502607453,0,0,-0.012012499502607453,0.012012499502607453,0,0.12012499502607453,0,0.024024999005214907,0,0,-0.012012499502607453,0,-0.024024999005214907,0,-0.012012499502607453,0,-0.03603749850782236,0,-0.060062497513037265,0.30031248756518636,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.012012499502607453,0.060062497513037265,0,0,0,0,-0.012012499502607453,0,0,0,-0.03603749850782236,0.012012499502607453,0,0.07207499701564472,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.024024999005214907,0,-0.012012499502607453,0,0,0.012012499502607453,-0.04804999801042981,0,0,0,-0.024024999005214907,0.012012499502607453,0,0,0,0.012012499502607453,-0.012012499502607453,0,0,0,-0.024024999005214907,0.024024999005214907,-0.03603749850782236,0,-0.04804999801042981,0,0,0,0,0,-0.09609999602085963,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.012012499502607453,0.024024999005214907,0,0.012012499502607453,0,0.024024999005214907,0,0,-0.03603749850782236,0,0,0.024024999005214907,0,0.024024999005214907,0,0.012012499502607453,0,0,-0.08408749651825217,0,0,0,0,0.012012499502607453,0,0.012012499502607453,-0.012012499502607453,0.08408749651825217,0,0.024024999005214907,0,0,-0.12012499502607453,0.024024999005214907,0,0.07207499701564472,0,0.024024999005214907,0,0,-0.1801874925391118,0.012012499502607453,0,0.024024999005214907,-0.024024999005214907,0,0,0,0,0.024024999005214907,0,0,-0.012012499502607453,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012012499502607453,-0.024024999005214907,0.012012499502607453,0,0,0,0,-0.10811249552346708,0.012012499502607453,0,0.012012499502607453,0,0.04804999801042981,0,0.03603749850782236,0,0,0,0,0,0.012012499502607453,0,0.012012499502607453,0,0,-0.012012499502607453,0.060062497513037265,-0.012012499502607453,0.03603749850782236,-0.024024999005214907,0.024024999005214907,0,0,0,0,-0.012012499502607453,0,-0.024024999005214907,0.012012499502607453,-0.012012499502607453,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04804999801042981,-0.012012499502607453,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012012499502607453,0,0,-0.03603749850782236,0.060062497513037265,-0.03603749850782236,0,-0.012012499502607453,0.20421249154432672,-0.03603749850782236,0,0,0,-0.024024999005214907,0.04804999801042981,-0.012012499502607453,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07207499701564472,-0.012012499502607453,0.024024999005214907,0,0.024024999005214907,0,0,-0.012012499502607453,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-133-1","text":"> There was one experiment which really was the kind of last dying whimper of the... well, it was a little bang I would say, of the original program. The original program was to look at the protein and then by doing genetics on the DNA and chemical mutagenesis is to work out the sequence of the DNA. That was the answer, i.e. the sequence of the coding. And the only place where that succeeded was with the nonsense codons. > > And that, that went roughly as follows. It had been known that some codons the... some mutations gave you nonsense. That had been discovered in the R2; because Seymour Benzer invented a little trick where he had a gene fusion and he could show he could turn off, in this gene fusion, the function of gene B, by some mutants in gene A, showing that these were important drastic mutants. I mean, we later used that to show that proflavine made very severe effects; that they could turn this off. > > Now, our work on the acridine mutants had shown us that a lot of the mutations, a lot of the codons had to be sense. That's because we could get frame-shifts over longer... over long regions. But we also knew that there was some nonsense. > > And so we started to work on these mutants; they were suppressible mutants, and I... and their history is quite interesting, because there were two strains of E. coli, and there were certain mutants that grew on one and didn't grow on the other, and in fact Seymour Benzer used that with the R2s, and so they then asked in Pasadena, 'Can we get this for other genes?' And so they called all the students together and said, **'We want you to do pick and stab, because you have to test each plaque individually, and the first one who finds the mutant we will call this after his mother'**. > > Okay. So the first student to find the mutant was a man called Hilliard Bernstein. All right, now you couldn't call them Bernstein mutants, but **amber – Bernstein is the German for amber**. So these mutants were called amber mutants. And that's how they remain, because they were called after Hilliard's mother who was also a Bernstein of course.","section":133,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0,-0.036898108190245485,0,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0,-0.036898108190245485,0,0,0.1291433786658592,0,0.07379621638049097,0,0.018449054095122742,-0.0922452704756137,0,-0.05534716228536823,0.036898108190245485,0,0.571920676948805,0,0,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0.018449054095122742,-0.036898108190245485,0.16604148685610468,-0.018449054095122742,0.31363391961708664,0,0.018449054095122742,-0.036898108190245485,0,0,0,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0.05534716228536823,-0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0,0,-0.036898108190245485,0,0,0,-0.036898108190245485,0,0,0,-0.07379621638049097,0.05534716228536823,-0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07379621638049097,0,-0.036898108190245485,0,0,0,0,0.16604148685610468,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0.018449054095122742,-0.05534716228536823,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0.05534716228536823,0,0.018449054095122742,-0.018449054095122742,0,-0.036898108190245485,0,-0.018449054095122742,0.036898108190245485,-0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05534716228536823,0.018449054095122742,0,0.036898108190245485,0,0,-0.036898108190245485,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0,0.018449054095122742,-0.07379621638049097,0,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0,0,0.05534716228536823,-0.018449054095122742,0,-0.036898108190245485,0.036898108190245485,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0922452704756137,0,0.018449054095122742,-0.07379621638049097,0,-0.036898108190245485,0,-0.018449054095122742,0.018449054095122742,0,0,-0.05534716228536823,0,0,0.40587919009270035,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0.036898108190245485,0,0,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0.07379621638049097,0,0.1291433786658592,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.036898108190245485,0.036898108190245485,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0.018449054095122742,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0,0,0.018449054095122742,-0.036898108190245485,0,0,0.018449054095122742,-0.1291433786658592,0,-0.0922452704756137,0.036898108190245485,-0.036898108190245485,0,0,0,0,0,-0.036898108190245485,0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0.018449054095122742,-0.0922452704756137,0.1844905409512274,0,0,0,0,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0,-0.11069432457073645,0,-0.018449054095122742,0,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0.05534716228536823,-0.018449054095122742,0.036898108190245485,-0.018449054095122742,0,-0.018449054095122742,0,0,0.036898108190245485,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0,-0.05534716228536823,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0,-0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0,0,-0.14759243276098194,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,-0.16604148685610468,0,0,0.05534716228536823,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0,0,0.036898108190245485,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,-0.036898108190245485,0.036898108190245485,-0.018449054095122742,0,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0,-0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0,0.036898108190245485,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0.07379621638049097,-0.018449054095122742,0.018449054095122742,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0.018449054095122742,-0.018449054095122742,0,0,0.1844905409512274,-0.036898108190245485,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.036898108190245485,-0.05534716228536823,0,0,0.036898108190245485,0,0.018449054095122742,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-134-1","text":"> These amber mutants had been known, and what was known is that they grew on one strain, didn't grow on the other, and I had... and you just said, 'well, what happens if you don't have an amino acid – what do you do?

Anand Sarabhai, one of my graduate students, who had what we call the luck of the Sarabhais, had in fact shown that amber mutants, these conditional lethals, cause chain termination, and that he could identify the chain terminated products directly without purification. And by doing this we were able to show, with a simple assumption, that a protein got started at one end and went to the other end and it was a topological argument that in fact **the genetic map was co-linear with the protein map**, not having to do sequences as Charles Yanofsky was doing at about the same time. > > Now, the amber mutants were very interesting, because what Anand had shown is that they chain terminated, and we then began to work on what were the amber triplets, and of course that is the only case where in fact we had completed the original program of molecular genetics without resorting to biochemistry. The idea was that we would analyse the structure of DNA by chemical mutagenesis. We'd analyse the structure of the protein and then we would be able to say, these triplets correspond to this protein, to this amino acid. > > We had already shown that there were these chain-terminating triplets in the R2 gene. In the R2 gene we had one strain in which the mutant could not grow. We had a strain, of course, where everything grew. So what we did is by using a chemical reagent, hydroxylamine, we treated bacteriophage with this. The argument is that hydroxylamine changed a base cytosine to uracil or an equivalent of it, and of course it could change one in the strand that has been copied into messenger or it could change one in the other strand. > > Therefore, if you took a family of bacteriophages containing some mutants and you passed them through the non-restrictive strain, then everything would ultimately become expressed. But if you took them and passed them through the restricting strain, then only those which contained unaltered cytosines on the sense strand, only those would grow through. And all the ones in which the cytosine had been altered on the sense strand so it was now read incorrectly, that would make a mutant gene product and would not pass through.","section":136,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.018854504950126014,0,0,0,0,-0.018854504950126014,0,-0.018854504950126014,0.03770900990025203,0,0,0,0,-0.018854504950126014,0,-0.05656351485037804,0,0,0.20739955445138614,0,0.11312702970075608,-0.03770900990025203,0.05656351485037804,-0.05656351485037804,0.03770900990025203,-0.03770900990025203,0.018854504950126014,-0.018854504950126014,0.5656351485037804,0,0,0,0,-0.018854504950126014,0,0,0.18854504950126014,0,0.22625405940151216,0,0,0,0,0,0.018854504950126014,0,0.018854504950126014,-0.018854504950126014,0.018854504950126014,0,0.018854504950126014,-0.018854504950126014,0.018854504950126014,0,0.03770900990025203,0,0,0,0,-0.018854504950126014,0,0,0.03770900990025203,0,0.018854504950126014,0,0,0,0,-0.018854504950126014,0.018854504950126014,0,0,0,0,-0.018854504950126014,0,0,0,0,0.13198153465088208,0,0,0,0,0,0.07541801980050405,0,0.018854504950126014,0,0,0,0.03770900990025203,0,0,0,0.07541801980050405,-0.03770900990025203,0.05656351485037804,-0.11312702970075608,0,0,0.018854504950126014,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03770900990025203,0,-0.09427252475063007,0.07541801980050405,0,0.018854504950126014,-0.018854504950126014,0,-0.03770900990025203,0,-0.018854504950126014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018854504950126014,0.07541801980050405,-0.09427252475063007,0.03770900990025203,0,0.05656351485037804,0,0,0,0.018854504950126014,-0.018854504950126014,0,0,0.03770900990025203,-0.018854504950126014,0.03770900990025203,-0.018854504950126014,0,-0.03770900990025203,0,-0.03770900990025203,0,0,0,-0.018854504950126014,0,-0.03770900990025203,0.018854504950126014,-0.018854504950126014,0.018854504950126014,0,0.20739955445138614,0,0.05656351485037804,0,0,-0.03770900990025203,0,0,0,0,0.018854504950126014,-0.018854504950126014,0.07541801980050405,0,0.2828175742518902,-0.018854504950126014,0,0,0,-0.05656351485037804,0,0,0.018854504950126014,0,0,0,0,0,0.018854504950126014,0,0,0,0.07541801980050405,0,0.05656351485037804,0,0,0,0,0,0.018854504950126014,0,0,-0.018854504950126014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018854504950126014,0,0.018854504950126014,0,0.03770900990025203,-0.018854504950126014,0,-0.018854504950126014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05656351485037804,0,0,0,-0.07541801980050405,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018854504950126014,0.11312702970075608,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07541801980050405,0,0,0,0,-0.018854504950126014,0,-0.05656351485037804,0,0,0.03770900990025203,0,0.03770900990025203,-0.018854504950126014,0.05656351485037804,0,0.05656351485037804,-0.018854504950126014,0,-0.018854504950126014,0.03770900990025203,0,0.09427252475063007,0,0,0,0,-0.09427252475063007,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03770900990025203,0.018854504950126014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.2828175742518902,0.03770900990025203,0,0,0,0,-0.07541801980050405,0,-0.018854504950126014,0,-0.05656351485037804,0.018854504950126014,0,0.018854504950126014,0,0,0,0,0,0.018854504950126014,-0.03770900990025203,0,-0.05656351485037804,0,0,0,-0.03770900990025203,0.03770900990025203,-0.03770900990025203,0.03770900990025203,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018854504950126014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09427252475063007,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07541801980050405,0,0.11312702970075608,-0.018854504950126014,0.03770900990025203,-0.018854504950126014,0,0,0.20739955445138614,-0.05656351485037804,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018854504950126014,0,0,0,0,0,0.07541801980050405,-0.13198153465088208,0,0,0,-0.018854504950126014,0.018854504950126014,-0.018854504950126014,0,-0.018854504950126014]},{"id":"transcript-137-1","text":"> What we knew is that the two nonsense triplets were related to each other by base changes.

And of course the first experiment was simply to take the normal allele of this and put it on the same phage and compare the two.","section":140,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.10297110457020561,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0,-0.025742776142551403,0.025742776142551403,0,0.0772283284276542,0,0.0772283284276542,0,0,-0.10297110457020561,0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0.38614164213827107,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0.1544566568553084,0,0.41188441828082245,0,0,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0,-0.051485552285102806,0,0,0,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0.051485552285102806,0,0.10297110457020561,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0.20594220914041123,0,0.0772283284276542,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,0.0772283284276542,-0.051485552285102806,0.0772283284276542,0,0,0,0.051485552285102806,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,-0.12871388071275702,0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0.051485552285102806,-0.12871388071275702,0,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0,-0.23168498528296264,0,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0.051485552285102806,0,0,0,0,0,0.051485552285102806,0,0,0,0,0,0.025742776142551403,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,0.051485552285102806,-0.025742776142551403,0.0772283284276542,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0,-0.051485552285102806,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0.051485552285102806,0,0.23168498528296264,-0.051485552285102806,0,0,0,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0.025742776142551403,-0.051485552285102806,0.051485552285102806,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.025742776142551403,-0.025742776142551403,0.051485552285102806,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0772283284276542,0.10297110457020561,-0.051485552285102806,0,-0.0772283284276542,0,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0.20594220914041123,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,0,-0.051485552285102806,0.051485552285102806,0,0,-0.051485552285102806,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.051485552285102806,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0.025742776142551403,-0.025742776142551403,0,-0.0772283284276542,0,0,0.28317053756806543,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0.0772283284276542,-0.051485552285102806,0,-0.025742776142551403,0.025742776142551403,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0.0772283284276542,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0.051485552285102806,0,0,0,0,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0,-0.12871388071275702,0.0772283284276542,0,0,0,0.025742776142551403,-0.051485552285102806,0,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.051485552285102806,0.0772283284276542,0,0,0,0.025742776142551403,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0.0772283284276542,-0.051485552285102806,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.051485552285102806,0,0.18019943299785982,-0.051485552285102806,0,-0.051485552285102806,0,0,0.23168498528296264,-0.051485552285102806,0,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,-0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.051485552285102806,-0.0772283284276542,0,0,0.025742776142551403,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-141-1","text":"> As a model of polarity I...

But if you're out of phase with the fashion you can do new things.","section":143,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,-0.03446739311292904,0,0,0.03446739311292904,-0.03446739311292904,0,0,0,-0.01723369655646452,0.01723369655646452,-0.03446739311292904,0,0,0.03446739311292904,0,0.06893478622585808,-0.01723369655646452,0,-0.05170108966939356,0,0,0,0,0.48254350358100656,0,0.01723369655646452,-0.01723369655646452,0,-0.05170108966939356,0,-0.01723369655646452,0.2585054483469678,0,0.430842413911613,-0.01723369655646452,0.06893478622585808,-0.03446739311292904,0,0,0,0,0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,0,0,0.03446739311292904,0,0.03446739311292904,-0.01723369655646452,0,-0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,0,0.03446739311292904,-0.01723369655646452,0.03446739311292904,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01723369655646452,0,0,0.03446739311292904,-0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,0,0.1723369655646452,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06893478622585808,0.01723369655646452,-0.01723369655646452,0,0,0.0861684827823226,-0.03446739311292904,0.03446739311292904,-0.06893478622585808,0.01723369655646452,0,0.01723369655646452,-0.03446739311292904,0,-0.01723369655646452,0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,0,-0.06893478622585808,0,-0.01723369655646452,0,0,0.03446739311292904,0,0.01723369655646452,-0.01723369655646452,0.0861684827823226,0,0,-0.10340217933878712,0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,0.01723369655646452,-0.13786957245171616,0.01723369655646452,0,0.03446739311292904,-0.01723369655646452,0,0,0.01723369655646452,-0.01723369655646452,0,-0.01723369655646452,0.05170108966939356,0,0,-0.05170108966939356,0.05170108966939356,0,0.01723369655646452,-0.03446739311292904,0,0,0,-0.01723369655646452,0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,0.03446739311292904,0,0.1723369655646452,0,0,-0.01723369655646452,0.01723369655646452,-0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03446739311292904,0,0.3274402345728259,-0.05170108966939356,0,-0.01723369655646452,0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,0.05170108966939356,0,0.01723369655646452,0,0,-0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,-0.0861684827823226,0.01723369655646452,-0.01723369655646452,0,0,0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,0,-0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,-0.01723369655646452,0,-0.05170108966939356,0,-0.03446739311292904,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01723369655646452,0,-0.01723369655646452,0,-0.03446739311292904,0.01723369655646452,-0.03446739311292904,0.01723369655646452,-0.05170108966939356,0,-0.05170108966939356,0,0,0.01723369655646452,-0.03446739311292904,0,0,0.03446739311292904,0,0,-0.01723369655646452,0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,0.01723369655646452,0,0.0861684827823226,0,0.03446739311292904,-0.03446739311292904,0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,0.03446739311292904,0,0,0,0,-0.05170108966939356,0,-0.03446739311292904,0,0,0,0,0.05170108966939356,0,0.03446739311292904,-0.01723369655646452,0.01723369655646452,0,0,-0.03446739311292904,0.01723369655646452,0,0.12063587589525164,-0.01723369655646452,0.01723369655646452,0,0.03446739311292904,-0.13786957245171616,0,0,0.03446739311292904,0,0,0,0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,0.03446739311292904,-0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.10340217933878712,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06893478622585808,0.01723369655646452,0,0,-0.03446739311292904,0,0,0.05170108966939356,-0.03446739311292904,0,0,0,-0.01723369655646452,0,0,0.03446739311292904,-0.03446739311292904,0,0,0.01723369655646452,-0.01723369655646452,0.01723369655646452,-0.01723369655646452,0.03446739311292904,-0.03446739311292904,0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03446739311292904,0,0.01723369655646452,0,0,-0.03446739311292904,0.01723369655646452,0,0.06893478622585808,-0.01723369655646452,0,0,0,-0.01723369655646452,0,-0.01723369655646452,0.06893478622585808,-0.03446739311292904,0,-0.01723369655646452,0.01723369655646452,-0.03446739311292904,0,0,0.2757391449034323,-0.06893478622585808,0,-0.01723369655646452,0,0,0.10340217933878712,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01723369655646452,0.03446739311292904,-0.03446739311292904,0,0,0.05170108966939356,0,0,-0.03446739311292904,0,-0.01723369655646452]},{"id":"transcript-144-1","text":"> About 1963, although we'd moved to our new building in the Hills Road, it had been agreed that we, we should get some more space.

And what I'd come to the conclusion was that we'd have to do electron microscopy. Now, why was that? That was very simple: because if I wanted to see which cell was joined to another cell, I would have to look at membranes. So I'd have to look, and this is the fault of all other microscopic anatomy, they all got lost in the neuropile, they couldn't trace out the connections. But **an electron microscope can resolve membranes, can resolve small things**, and so we said, well, with the electron microscope you could trace the path quite... quite adequately. > > And what we needed to do was to do three-dimensional electron microscopy, just get all the information. Now, how were we going to do that? In a very classical mode. I had, as a student, reconstructed a brain of galago by serial sectioning of colloidal sections, and by tracing these on paper and transferring these to slices of wax, I actually made a three-dimensional model of this brain in wax with all the... the holes in it and you could open it up and look inside, and so we decided we'd have to do something like that. > > We'd have to cut serial sections and we'd have to go from one section to the other and trace it. Now, the electron microscope is extremely powerful, but it has a very tiny window, you can only look at a small piece of it at a time.

Well, it should be possible to take nervous systems where you have a wiring diagram and compute with them that if you assumed these were excitatory and these were inhibitory you will find that certain states of these systems jam. They're incompatible. > > And, in fact, it seems to me to be very reasonable to start to ask what things, given this kind of general structure, are impossible. Because **exclusion is always a tremendously good thing in science**, if you can say it is impossible for this to be inhibitory; we actually could show that in one small sub-case, which we did. > > And I think when people said, how would you actually do this, then the argument was: it would be done by simulation. And it was during that time that I developed the concept I called then **a proper simulation as against an improper one**. Now, let me just give a definition of that. If you take these little worms, they crawl around on the surface of an agar plate, and anybody can write a program on a Macintosh or any computer that has little worms crawling around on a screen - little squiggles - and they squiggle around and they... they look as though they're doing the right thing. And you say, there you are, I've simulated the movement of the worm.

It's a... it's a description. What I would have expected to find in the program were lists of neurones, lists of connections, lists of things that have to happen, right. And so **a proper simulation must be done in the machine language of the object being simulated**. > > And I think that if you do it that way, then I argue **the computer program is the explanation**. Now, if you have that, you can explain everything about the nervous system, all right. Now, you need a complete wiring diagram because modellers... there's always... are always confronted by the sceptic. So if you come and explain to the sceptic, 'I have modelled this behaviour, we got this oscillator, this interacts with this, it's coupled in this way and it does it', and he says, 'That's very nice, but how do you know there isn't another wire which goes from this point, you know, comes, goes right around the back and comes in at the side again?'

Unfortunately, we lost the culture - some of these were hard to maintain - but we certainly got up to over 60 of these strains.","section":149,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0.05636598887755415,-0.028182994438777077,0.028182994438777077,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0.05636598887755415,0,0.028182994438777077,-0.1127319777551083,0,0,0.028182994438777077,-0.05636598887755415,0.4791109054592103,0,0,0,0.028182994438777077,-0.028182994438777077,0.08454898331633123,0,0.2254639555102166,-0.028182994438777077,0.33819593326532493,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05636598887755415,0,0,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0,-0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0.028182994438777077,0,0.05636598887755415,0,0.05636598887755415,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.028182994438777077,-0.028182994438777077,0.05636598887755415,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0.14091497219388538,-0.028182994438777077,0,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,0,0.08454898331633123,0,0,0,0.05636598887755415,0,0.028182994438777077,-0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0,-0.05636598887755415,0,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0,-0.05636598887755415,0.1127319777551083,0,0,-0.05636598887755415,0.028182994438777077,0,0.028182994438777077,-0.05636598887755415,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08454898331633123,0,0.028182994438777077,-0.028182994438777077,0.028182994438777077,-0.05636598887755415,0,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0,0,0.1127319777551083,0,0.16909796663266247,-0.14091497219388538,0,-0.08454898331633123,0.05636598887755415,-0.028182994438777077,0,0,0.028182994438777077,-0.08454898331633123,0,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0,-0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0.08454898331633123,0,0,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0,-0.08454898331633123,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05636598887755415,0,0,0.028182994438777077,-0.05636598887755415,0,-0.05636598887755415,0,-0.05636598887755415,0,0,0,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.2254639555102166,0.16909796663266247,0,0.028182994438777077,-0.19728096107143953,0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,0.05636598887755415,0,0,0,0,-0.1127319777551083,0,0,0.08454898331633123,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0.08454898331633123,0,0,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0.08454898331633123,-0.028182994438777077,0.028182994438777077,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0,-0.05636598887755415,0,-0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,0.08454898331633123,0,0,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,-0.16909796663266247,0,0,0,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0,0,0.05636598887755415,-0.05636598887755415,0,0,0,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0,-0.05636598887755415,0,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0.08454898331633123,0,0,0,0,0,0.05636598887755415,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0.028182994438777077,-0.028182994438777077,0,0,0.33819593326532493,-0.05636598887755415,0,0,0,-0.028182994438777077,0.028182994438777077,0,0.028182994438777077,0,0,0,0,0,0.05636598887755415,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-150-1","text":"> Eventually what it turned out is that a very famous nematode called *Caenorhabditis elegans* was the one that worked.

This other one was called Bristol. > > And there was, there was a man called Dougherty in the United States - was at Berkeley - and he was interested in nematodes, had been for a long time. He worked in a department of nutrition, and was interested in what did nematodes eat. > > And out of all of these animals I... I liked very much *C. elegans*, because it had a beautiful sex life. It was what is called **the self-fertilising hermaphrodite**. That is first the gonad develops into a testis, and then stops, and then the gonad switches off to make oocytes and then these two fertilise each other. So each animal is the result of a cross of itself with itself, and **there's no better inbreeding than to cross yourselves with yourself all the time**. > > So this animal then had the property of being completely isogenic, because each animal would have a uniform genetic constitution, it would be a clone, so to speak.

Then also these nematodes have occasional males which crop up in cultures and you can use these males to move genes from one animal to another. > > That gave you the whole basis of doing genetics.

And so by slow freezing, about a degree a minute, you could in fact preserve these animals and thaw them and have them come alive.","section":151,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.04487871088652002,0,0,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0,0,0.02243935544326001,-0.04487871088652002,0,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0.02243935544326001,0,0.06731806632978003,-0.04487871088652002,0,-0.11219677721630004,0,-0.02243935544326001,0,-0.04487871088652002,0.4263477534219402,0,0,-0.04487871088652002,0,-0.13463613265956006,0.02243935544326001,0,0.31415097620564014,-0.02243935544326001,0.3365903316489001,0,0,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0,0,0.13463613265956006,0,0,0,0,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04487871088652002,0,0,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0.04487871088652002,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0.02243935544326001,-0.02243935544326001,0,-0.2468329098758601,0,0,0.04487871088652002,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06731806632978003,0.02243935544326001,-0.02243935544326001,0,-0.02243935544326001,0,0,0.02243935544326001,-0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06731806632978003,0,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.15707548810282007,-0.02243935544326001,0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0,-0.02243935544326001,0.2468329098758601,-0.02243935544326001,0,-0.06731806632978003,0,0,0,0,0.06731806632978003,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0.04487871088652002,0,0,0,0,0,0.04487871088652002,-0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0.11219677721630004,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04487871088652002,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0.04487871088652002,0,0,-0.06731806632978003,0,0,0,-0.04487871088652002,0,-0.04487871088652002,0,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0.04487871088652002,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0.04487871088652002,-0.02243935544326001,0,-0.06731806632978003,0.17951484354608008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0.04487871088652002,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0,0.04487871088652002,0,0.11219677721630004,0,0.08975742177304004,0,0,0,0,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0.26927226531912013,0,0,0,0,-0.06731806632978003,0,0,0,-0.04487871088652002,0,-0.02243935544326001,0.04487871088652002,-0.06731806632978003,0.02243935544326001,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0.04487871088652002,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.20195419898934008,0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0,0,0.02243935544326001,-0.04487871088652002,0,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.13463613265956006,0,0,0,-0.06731806632978003,0,-0.02243935544326001,0,0,0.04487871088652002,0,0,-0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0,0.06731806632978003,0,0,0,0,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0.06731806632978003,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0.04487871088652002,-0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0,0.04487871088652002,0,0,0,0.26927226531912013,-0.06731806632978003,0,0,0,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0.04487871088652002,0,0,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0.02243935544326001,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-152-1","text":"> We also found very quickly that they were susceptible to mutagenesis, by a compound called EMS - ethylmethane sulphonate - and indeed, you can mutate their genes at about the same frequency as you can mutate the genes of the *E. coli*...

All you needed was a dissecting microscope so you should look at them. There were very remarkable things happened. For example, people said, how do you pick behavioural mutants? What you have, you have a whole lot of nematodes, some of them are mutants, some of them are not. And what turned out is you have to learn what it is. And you do it by the following criteria: **anything that looks funny or different, you pick it up and you put it on a little petri dish by itself. If its children are different - show the same difference - well, then it's a mutant because it's inherited**, all right. > > And now you can look... then you have to cross it and make sure you can segregate the mutant in 1/4 of the population.

And you plateau and this means you've learnt to discern all of these and you start now to find repeats, and this has happened to everybody in this field.","section":153,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,0,0.017147337032429676,-0.017147337032429676,0.017147337032429676,0,0.05144201109728903,0,0.1543260332918671,-0.017147337032429676,0,-0.0685893481297187,0.017147337032429676,0,0,-0.03429467406485935,0.6515988072323277,0,0,0,0,-0.017147337032429676,0.03429467406485935,0,0.2743573925188748,0,0.32579940361616383,0,0.05144201109728903,0,0,0,0.017147337032429676,-0.017147337032429676,0.017147337032429676,-0.017147337032429676,0,0,0.017147337032429676,-0.05144201109728903,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,0,0.05144201109728903,-0.03429467406485935,0,-0.03429467406485935,0,-0.03429467406485935,0,0,0.03429467406485935,0,0.017147337032429676,-0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0.0685893481297187,-0.017147337032429676,0.05144201109728903,-0.017147337032429676,0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03429467406485935,0,-0.017147337032429676,0.017147337032429676,0,0.017147337032429676,-0.05144201109728903,0,0,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0,-0.0685893481297187,0,0,0,-0.03429467406485935,0.017147337032429676,-0.017147337032429676,0.03429467406485935,-0.017147337032429676,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,-0.08573668516214838,0.017147337032429676,0,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,-0.10288402219457805,0,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0.017147337032429676,-0.017147337032429676,0,-0.017147337032429676,0.017147337032429676,0,0,-0.03429467406485935,0.03429467406485935,-0.017147337032429676,0,-0.03429467406485935,0,0,0.03429467406485935,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0,0,0.05144201109728903,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0.017147337032429676,-0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,-0.03429467406485935,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,0,0.08573668516214838,-0.03429467406485935,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0685893481297187,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0.03429467406485935,0,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,-0.05144201109728903,0.017147337032429676,-0.03429467406485935,0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05144201109728903,0.05144201109728903,0,0,-0.03429467406485935,0.017147337032429676,-0.017147337032429676,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,-0.08573668516214838,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,-0.03429467406485935,0.017147337032429676,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0,-0.08573668516214838,0.05144201109728903,0,0,-0.0685893481297187,0,0,0.03429467406485935,-0.017147337032429676,0,-0.03429467406485935,0,0,0,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0.05144201109728903,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0,-0.03429467406485935,0,0,0.2057680443891561,0,0,0,0,-0.08573668516214838,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017147337032429676,0.017147337032429676,0,0.05144201109728903,0,0.05144201109728903,-0.017147337032429676,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0,0,-0.18862070735672642,0.017147337032429676,0,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,-0.10288402219457805,0.017147337032429676,0,0,-0.0685893481297187,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03429467406485935,-0.017147337032429676,0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0.03429467406485935,0,0.0685893481297187,-0.03429467406485935,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0,0.017147337032429676,-0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0,0.017147337032429676,-0.05144201109728903,0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017147337032429676,0.017147337032429676,-0.017147337032429676,0.017147337032429676,-0.03429467406485935,0,-0.017147337032429676,0.29150472955130446,-0.0685893481297187,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,0,0.03429467406485935,-0.017147337032429676,0,-0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0,0.08573668516214838,-0.08573668516214838,0,0,0.017147337032429676,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-154-1","text":"> Then I started to work on drugs.

The idea was – and it was one of the things that Lewis Wolpert had put forward as... a new idea in embryology – that **cells took up their characteristics from their positions in a gradient field**. Now the... the idea of gradients in development is very old. It goes back to the last years of the last century [sic], where in fact gradients were observed in eggs. But this idea was in fact, I think, very novel and Lewis didn't get much interest in this. > > I can remember finding Lewis in Woods Hole in the late '60s very depressed, saying that he'd given these lectures on gradients and no one had paid any attention to him. At that time I was teaching in Woods Hole and I can remember people discussing questions like, is differentiation a state or a process? And in fact, to try and explain the difference between these, I asked people the... what is the difference between laid-back and mellowing out? Some of... some people may remember these great words of the '60s.

And this language I found in a publication, it's called TRAC — T-R-A-C — It's Text Reckoner And Compiler, published in the *Journal of the American Association of Computing Machinery*, 1965, by a man called Calvin Mooers, who I ascertained two years ago was still alive. > > And I was very impressed by this because I actually did write an interpreter for it, and... and became so fascinated by this language that **even on my present machines the first thing I've done is write an interpreter for Trac**, and my versions of Trac include a whole lot of new constructs, and these have never been published.

And of course if you were to think of... of how that... that would work, you would have to have a very large number of specific molecules. > > Now, of course at the time many people thought that there is another thing where we seem to have a lot of specific molecules; it's in the immunological system. You know, everybody said something we called **the Beilstein paradox**. Beilstein is a big, is a big book of organic chemistry and describes all the organic chemicals that have been found. And people have said well, we're sure that if you take a chemical out of Beilstein you can make an antibody to it. And of course we have to think not only there... are there a 122 volumes of Beilstein now, but there's going to be, you know, 10^22 volumes of Beilstein written over the next 20 years, and of course this statement will be equally true. So how does the antibody first of all know what's been published in Beilstein and secondly, a more, a deeper question: how's it going... how does it know what is not yet published in Beilstein but will be in the future? > > So what is in fact the landscape of this area of chemical... of molecular recognition? And it becomes very clear that it has to be a rather more complicated thing than, you know, one antigen, one antibody, and it means that **everything must be pluralistic** in a sense. That is, one antigen can be recognised by more than one antibody, and perhaps one antibody can recognise more than one antigen, and then we can, we can think of how that will become a code. > > Szilárd, in fact, wrote a paper about how the nervous system would be wired up by this form of chemical recognition, and what is more, he used the paradigm of immunisation as a model of learning. In other words, if you wanted to do new things you kind of formed a molecule, an antibody, if you like, that... that learnt what this new thing in, and therefore that would allow you to have learnt it. In that sense the antibody system does show a kind of molecular learning thing; once exposed to a chemical configuration it learns what that is and produces an antibody. > > Now of course it doesn't learn it in the sense of doing some big interpretation of the structure then computing what it has to do. Because that would be one way of learning, and of course it learns by being totally ignorant, which is the cheapest way. Which it says, **if it works do it, if it doesn't work forget about it**. And so I mean, it is learning under the regime of total ignorance that distinguishes the antibody system from what we might speculate as learning. This is quite important because many people now can't make the clear distinction between selection and acquisition in this sense.","section":163,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.11479049674466331,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0,0,0.04304643627924874,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0,-0.028697624186165827,0,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0.07174406046541457,0,0.10044168465158039,-0.057395248372331654,0.014348812093082914,-0.057395248372331654,0,-0.057395248372331654,0.04304643627924874,0,0.4448131748855703,0,0,-0.014348812093082914,0,-0.028697624186165827,0,0,0.17218574511699497,-0.014348812093082914,0.25827861767549243,0,0.028697624186165827,-0.014348812093082914,0,0,0,0,0.014348812093082914,-0.028697624186165827,0,0,0.014348812093082914,-0.028697624186165827,0.04304643627924874,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0,-0.04304643627924874,0,0,0,-0.057395248372331654,0.028697624186165827,0,0.014348812093082914,-0.014348812093082914,0,-0.04304643627924874,0.028697624186165827,-0.014348812093082914,0.014348812093082914,-0.014348812093082914,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014348812093082914,0.014348812093082914,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0,-0.028697624186165827,0.028697624186165827,-0.04304643627924874,0,0,0,0,0.10044168465158039,-0.028697624186165827,0.04304643627924874,0,0,0,0.04304643627924874,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0,0,0,-0.014348812093082914,0,-0.10044168465158039,0,0,0.028697624186165827,0,0.014348812093082914,-0.014348812093082914,0,-0.014348812093082914,0,0,0,-0.10044168465158039,0,-0.014348812093082914,0,0,0,-0.08609287255849749,0,0,0,-0.014348812093082914,0,0,0.014348812093082914,-0.014348812093082914,0.014348812093082914,0,0.028697624186165827,-0.04304643627924874,0,-0.07174406046541457,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014348812093082914,0.014348812093082914,-0.014348812093082914,0,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0,0,0.17218574511699497,0,0.028697624186165827,0,0.028697624186165827,0,0,-0.014348812093082914,0,0,0,0,0.07174406046541457,-0.014348812093082914,0.27262742976857535,0,0,0,0.057395248372331654,0,0,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0.014348812093082914,-0.028697624186165827,0,0,0,-0.014348812093082914,0.028697624186165827,0,0.04304643627924874,0,0,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0.028697624186165827,0,0,-0.014348812093082914,0,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0,-0.014348812093082914,0,0,0,-0.014348812093082914,0,0,0,-0.028697624186165827,0,-0.057395248372331654,0,-0.014348812093082914,0,0,0,-0.014348812093082914,0,-0.08609287255849749,0,0,0,-0.028697624186165827,0,0,0,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0,-0.014348812093082914,0.014348812093082914,0,0,-0.028697624186165827,0,0,0,0,0.04304643627924874,0,0,0,0,-0.028697624186165827,0.014348812093082914,-0.07174406046541457,0,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0.08609287255849749,0,0.04304643627924874,-0.028697624186165827,0.028697624186165827,0,0,-0.11479049674466331,0,-0.014348812093082914,0.27262742976857535,-0.028697624186165827,0.057395248372331654,0,0.014348812093082914,-0.2152321813962437,0,0,0.014348812093082914,-0.014348812093082914,0,0,0.08609287255849749,-0.014348812093082914,0,0,0.04304643627924874,-0.014348812093082914,0.028697624186165827,0,0.014348812093082914,-0.014348812093082914,0,0,0.014348812093082914,-0.10044168465158039,0,0,0,0,0,-0.14348812093082913,0.04304643627924874,0,0,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0.028697624186165827,0,0,0,0,0,0.014348812093082914,-0.12913930883774621,0,-0.028697624186165827,0,0,0,-0.028697624186165827,0.04304643627924874,-0.014348812093082914,0.028697624186165827,-0.014348812093082914,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.028697624186165827,0,0,-0.014348812093082914,0.014348812093082914,0,0.014348812093082914,0,0.10044168465158039,0,0,0,0,0,0.10044168465158039,0,0,0,0.08609287255849749,-0.028697624186165827,0.057395248372331654,-0.04304643627924874,0,0,0.4161155506994045,0,0,-0.08609287255849749,0.014348812093082914,0,0.057395248372331654,-0.014348812093082914,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04304643627924874,-0.08609287255849749,0.014348812093082914,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-164-1","text":"> This idea that every connection, so to speak, in the nervous system would be encoded by a specific molecular interaction gave rise to a lot of problems.

And I think that we've got to be very careful about the analogies we import from our conscious experience into our biology.","section":165,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.14002800840280097,0,0,0,0,0,0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0.4900980294098034,0,0,-0.07001400420140048,0.03500700210070024,-0.10502100630210073,0,-0.03500700210070024,0.3150630189063022,0,0.3500700210070024,-0.14002800840280097,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.14002800840280097,0,0,0,0,0.10502100630210073,0,0,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.14002800840280097,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03500700210070024,-0.10502100630210073,0,0,0.03500700210070024,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0.03500700210070024,0,0,-0.10502100630210073,0,0,0.03500700210070024,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07001400420140048,0,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0.03500700210070024,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0.1750350105035012,0,0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07001400420140048,0,0,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07001400420140048,0,0.21004201260420147,-0.1750350105035012,0,0,0,0,0.03500700210070024,0,0.03500700210070024,0,0.07001400420140048,0,0,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,-0.03500700210070024,0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0.10502100630210073,-0.10502100630210073,0,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07001400420140048,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07001400420140048,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07001400420140048,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.10502100630210073,0,0.03500700210070024,-0.03500700210070024,0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14002800840280097,-0.03500700210070024,0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,-0.07001400420140048,0,0,0.03500700210070024,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1750350105035012,0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,-0.07001400420140048,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.21004201260420147,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0.03500700210070024,-0.03500700210070024,0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03500700210070024,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0.10502100630210073,0,0,0,0.21004201260420147,-0.03500700210070024,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0.07001400420140048,-0.03500700210070024,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-166-1","text":"> I never forget that I was once asked whether I would meet a man who was the President of The British Computing Society, and I said, sure, and he came up and we had lunch together in Cambridge.

We lived together in the, the old hut at the, at the Cavendish, in... till 1962, when we moved up to Hills Road, to the new lab. > > And what we had done in the new lab was to equip it with blackboards. We still liked chalk and blackboards. We had one blackboard in our old little office, but we acquired lots of them. There were three altogether. And **on this blackboard we would meet, often every day, and talk about everything**. We could talk about an experimental result and say what could this possibly mean? Or Francis would tell me he's just read this paper, these are his views about it. > > And what was very interesting is that we pursued very... very different, divergent paths, we... but came together for these discussions. The Americans in our lab always wanted journal clubs or formal discussion groups. I've never been in favour of this. And I tell them if they want it, they organise it themselves, I'm not going to organise it. > > I did for a year, form something called **the SB Educational Society**, in which everybody was told with 5 minutes' notice, that they had to come and tell me what they were doing to educate me. This again also wasn't liked by the Americans, who required time for preparation of what they had to say. But it seemed to me **if you had to prepare anything on what you were doing at the moment you'd better get worried about that, because it means you don't know what you're doing**. > > However, those... the other very informal discussion group was known as **the Saturday morning coffee**. In the lab we congregated in the kitchen, the sterilising kitchen on the second floor, where we made coffee on a Saturday morning. And there people came from all over the lab, and at the coffee there, would discuss everything: molecular structure, embryology, psychology, sometimes politics, just anything. > > But there were many, many interesting discussions there, and I feel **this kind of ongoing conversation is so important to science**. It's important because I'm not the sort of person that likes to think in, in isolation. There are a number of people I know who go away and cook up a whole theory and then come and do it. I don't. I think a lot of what's beneficial is by conversation, because **an idea usually forms in my mind, it's at least 50% wrong the first time it appears**. There's something wrong with it. And it's only in playing with it, if I can call it that, that you can refine it and see what its essential things. > > And I believe that interaction is... is sort of part of the great joys of science, of suddenly saying, gee, you know, I actually got it wrong the first time, now I can see it. And of course the other great joy is to be able to convert that into an experiment, then go and do the experiment and get the answer.","section":167,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.015132420606875913,0,0,0,0,-0.04539726182062774,0.030264841213751826,0,0.07566210303437956,0,0,0,0.015132420606875913,-0.015132420606875913,0,-0.030264841213751826,0,0,0.1210593648550073,0,0.07566210303437956,-0.015132420606875913,0.030264841213751826,-0.030264841213751826,0,0,0.030264841213751826,0,0.5296347212406569,-0.015132420606875913,0,-0.06052968242750365,0,-0.06052968242750365,0.030264841213751826,0,0.2421187297100146,0,0.30264841213751825,0,0,-0.04539726182062774,0,-0.015132420606875913,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04539726182062774,0.015132420606875913,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.030264841213751826,0,0,0,-0.015132420606875913,0.07566210303437956,-0.015132420606875913,0,-0.04539726182062774,0,-0.015132420606875913,0,-0.015132420606875913,0,-0.015132420606875913,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.015132420606875913,-0.015132420606875913,0.06052968242750365,-0.030264841213751826,0.030264841213751826,0,0,0,0.015132420606875913,0,0,0,0.015132420606875913,-0.07566210303437956,0,-0.015132420606875913,0,0,0.015132420606875913,-0.04539726182062774,0.030264841213751826,-0.030264841213751826,0,0,0.06052968242750365,0,0,-0.030264841213751826,0,0,0,0,0.030264841213751826,-0.030264841213751826,0,-0.04539726182062774,0,0,0.1361917854618832,-0.030264841213751826,0.015132420606875913,-0.04539726182062774,0.015132420606875913,0,0,0,0,-0.015132420606875913,0,-0.015132420606875913,0.015132420606875913,-0.10592694424813139,0,0,0.030264841213751826,0,0,0,0,-0.015132420606875913,0,0,0.07566210303437956,0,0,-0.030264841213751826,0.04539726182062774,0,0.015132420606875913,-0.030264841213751826,0,0,0.030264841213751826,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.015132420606875913,0.2269863091031387,0,0.06052968242750365,-0.015132420606875913,0.07566210303437956,-0.015132420606875913,0,-0.030264841213751826,0,-0.06052968242750365,0,-0.015132420606875913,0.06052968242750365,0,0.18158904728251096,-0.015132420606875913,0,-0.04539726182062774,0,0,0,0,0.015132420606875913,-0.015132420606875913,0,0,0,-0.015132420606875913,0,0,0,-0.030264841213751826,0.030264841213751826,0,0.04539726182062774,0,0,-0.015132420606875913,0.015132420606875913,-0.015132420606875913,0,0,0.015132420606875913,-0.015132420606875913,0,-0.030264841213751826,0,-0.06052968242750365,0,0,0,-0.015132420606875913,0,0,0.030264841213751826,0,0.030264841213751826,-0.030264841213751826,0,0,0.030264841213751826,-0.06052968242750365,0.015132420606875913,-0.10592694424813139,0,-0.04539726182062774,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04539726182062774,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04539726182062774,0,-0.015132420606875913,0.015132420606875913,-0.015132420606875913,0,0,0.07566210303437956,0,0,-0.030264841213751826,0.06052968242750365,-0.015132420606875913,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07566210303437956,0,0,0,0,0.07566210303437956,0,0.07566210303437956,0,0.04539726182062774,0,0.04539726182062774,0,0,-0.015132420606875913,0.04539726182062774,-0.030264841213751826,0.2723835709237664,-0.04539726182062774,0,0,0.030264841213751826,-0.09079452364125548,0.015132420606875913,0,0,-0.015132420606875913,0,-0.04539726182062774,0,-0.04539726182062774,0,0,0.07566210303437956,-0.06052968242750365,0.015132420606875913,0,0.030264841213751826,0,0,0,0,-0.18158904728251096,0,0,0,0,0,-0.19672146788938688,0,-0.015132420606875913,0.015132420606875913,0,0,0,0.030264841213751826,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.015132420606875913,-0.015132420606875913,0.015132420606875913,0,0.015132420606875913,0,0,0,0,-0.030264841213751826,0,0,0,-0.030264841213751826,0.04539726182062774,-0.04539726182062774,0.015132420606875913,0,0.015132420606875913,-0.030264841213751826,0,0,0.06052968242750365,-0.015132420606875913,0,0,0.015132420606875913,0,0,0,0.030264841213751826,-0.015132420606875913,0.06052968242750365,0,0.07566210303437956,-0.015132420606875913,0,0,0.2269863091031387,-0.09079452364125548,0,-0.030264841213751826,0.030264841213751826,0,0.04539726182062774,0,0,-0.015132420606875913,0,0,0.015132420606875913,-0.015132420606875913,0.030264841213751826,-0.030264841213751826,0.04539726182062774,0,0,0,0.015132420606875913,-0.015132420606875913,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-168-1","text":"> The whole of the *C. elegans* project wasn't anything like the science I'd done earlier.

So I said well **let's see if any of these genes correspond to the structural proteins of muscle**.

What we did is we grew fermenters of bacteria, then we threw in nematodes and they ate all the bacteria and so we would then harvest the nematodes. > > And that enabled us to isolate from these animals reasonable quantities of these proteins and begin the long job of finding out which of these mutants corresponded to this. And of course one of the ones we found out is that there was a gene apparently which we'd studied extensively called **unc-54**, which apparently controlled a major component of the body musculature — the heavy chain of myosin. > > And a lot of our work then turned, partly to looking at other genes in this, and later we found, Bob Waterston found that another gene controlled — unc-15 — controlled the specification of another protein called paramyosin. And it became very clear in working through this, and by... we were able to prove that that was the structural gene and not another gene that told another gene to make myosin, because we found that physical changes in myosin modif... were specified by the same gene.","section":170,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,-0.019062321291575583,0.019062321291575583,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0.07624928516630233,0,0.15249857033260467,-0.019062321291575583,0,-0.09531160645787792,0,-0.09531160645787792,0,0,0.3431217832483605,0,0.019062321291575583,-0.07624928516630233,0,-0.038124642583151166,0,0,0.17156089162418026,-0.038124642583151166,0.3621841045399361,0,0,-0.038124642583151166,0,-0.038124642583151166,0,0,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0.038124642583151166,0,0,0,0,-0.05718696387472675,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0.038124642583151166,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0.17156089162418026,-0.019062321291575583,0.05718696387472675,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,-0.05718696387472675,0.05718696387472675,-0.038124642583151166,0.09531160645787792,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0.05718696387472675,0,0.038124642583151166,-0.038124642583151166,0,0,0.019062321291575583,-0.019062321291575583,0.038124642583151166,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0.019062321291575583,-0.09531160645787792,0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,-0.05718696387472675,0,-0.038124642583151166,0.038124642583151166,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0.019062321291575583,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0.19062321291575585,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0.038124642583151166,0,0.3812464258315117,0,0,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0.019062321291575583,-0.019062321291575583,0.019062321291575583,0,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0.1143739277494535,0,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0.038124642583151166,0,0,0,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0,-0.038124642583151166,0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0,0.07624928516630233,-0.038124642583151166,0.019062321291575583,-0.038124642583151166,0,-0.05718696387472675,0.019062321291575583,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0.038124642583151166,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05718696387472675,0.038124642583151166,-0.019062321291575583,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.038124642583151166,0,0.1143739277494535,-0.09531160645787792,0.019062321291575583,-0.019062321291575583,0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0.05718696387472675,0,0,0,0,-0.07624928516630233,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,-0.038124642583151166,0.038124642583151166,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0.019062321291575583,-0.3621841045399361,0.019062321291575583,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,-0.07624928516630233,0.019062321291575583,0,0.05718696387472675,0,0,0,0,-0.038124642583151166,0,0,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.038124642583151166,0,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0.038124642583151166,0,0.038124642583151166,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0.3812464258315117,-0.019062321291575583,0.019062321291575583,-0.019062321291575583,0.038124642583151166,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0,-0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0.07624928516630233,-0.05718696387472675,0.019062321291575583,0,0.019062321291575583,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-171-1","text":"> The mutants of the nervous system, I started to look at very early on, and found that many of those that were not muscle mutants had very large deviations in the organisation of their neurones.

You have to realise that at that time we still did not know that genes contained introns. And what I'd thought was we would take all the genes and we would glue them down on a page of nitrocellulose and this would be the Book of Man and you could turn to page 48, line 23, word four, and there you'd have the gene for serum albumin written there. And so the concept that one could just get the genes by working with DNA was of course very much alive and of course being in Cambridge where Fred Sanger was sequencing DNA, realised that **this is on the threshold of the new genetics**. And the new genetics is then what I became extremely interested in.","section":181,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08451542547285165,0,0,-0.042257712736425826,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0,-0.042257712736425826,0,-0.1267731382092775,0,0,0.5916079783099616,0,0,0,0,-0.042257712736425826,0,0,0.1267731382092775,-0.042257712736425826,0.3803194146278324,-0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08451542547285165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.042257712736425826,0.042257712736425826,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0,-0.042257712736425826,0.1267731382092775,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0,0,-0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0,0,-0.042257712736425826,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0,-0.08451542547285165,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1267731382092775,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0,-0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0.1267731382092775,0,0,0,0,-0.08451542547285165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0.21128856368212912,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08451542547285165,0,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0.08451542547285165,0,0.042257712736425826,-0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0,0,-0.042257712736425826,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0,-0.1267731382092775,0,-0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08451542547285165,0,0,0.1267731382092775,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08451542547285165,0.042257712736425826,-0.042257712736425826,0,-0.08451542547285165,0,-0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1267731382092775,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08451542547285165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,-0.042257712736425826,0.042257712736425826,-0.08451542547285165,0,0,0.08451542547285165,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08451542547285165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0.1690308509457033,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1267731382092775,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0.2958039891549808,-0.042257712736425826,0,-0.042257712736425826,0.042257712736425826,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1267731382092775,0,0,0,0.042257712736425826,0,0,-0.042257712736425826,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-182-1","text":"> I hadn't realised in America how much things had changed.

And so this kind of uncanny never-neverland which... which just made no sense of anything became the way in which one did these experiments over the next few years.","section":183,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08838834764831843,0,0,0,0,-0.08838834764831843,0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0.044194173824159216,0,0.13258252147247765,0,0,-0.22097086912079608,0,-0.044194173824159216,0.08838834764831843,0,0.48613591206575135,0,0,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0.17677669529663687,0,0.22097086912079608,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17677669529663687,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08838834764831843,0,-0.08838834764831843,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0.13258252147247765,0,0,0,0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13258252147247765,0,0.22097086912079608,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0.044194173824159216,0,0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0.044194173824159216,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,-0.17677669529663687,0,0,0,-0.08838834764831843,0,0,0,0,0,-0.13258252147247765,0.08838834764831843,0,0,0,0,0,0.044194173824159216,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13258252147247765,-0.08838834764831843,0,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.22097086912079608,-0.08838834764831843,0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,0.08838834764831843,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.044194173824159216,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08838834764831843,0,0,0,-0.08838834764831843,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0.044194173824159216,0,0,-0.13258252147247765,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08838834764831843,0.044194173824159216,-0.08838834764831843,0,-0.08838834764831843,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.044194173824159216,0,0,-0.22097086912079608,0,0,0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0.044194173824159216,-0.044194173824159216,0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.044194173824159216,0,0.044194173824159216,0,0,-0.08838834764831843,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08838834764831843,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0.08838834764831843,0,0,0,0.13258252147247765,0,0,0,0,0,0.044194173824159216,0,0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,0.044194173824159216,0,0.08838834764831843,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.044194173824159216,0,0.13258252147247765,0,0.044194173824159216,-0.08838834764831843,0,0,0.13258252147247765,0,0,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0.08838834764831843,0,0,-0.044194173824159216,0,-0.044194173824159216]},{"id":"transcript-184-1","text":"> Well, this period where one was trying to get... the science going because one realised that this was the important thing for solving many of the problems in biology, was I think, difficult all over the world, and I spent an inordinate amount of time working in the field and also trying to change things. In this country they set up a committee called the Genetic Manipulation Committee, it had lots of representatives, and we got a workable system. But one of the things that became perfectly obvious after all of this had got established was that **no one actually believed it was dangerous**. And it is very difficult to get people to play at being safe when they know it's... they can't... they cannot see what would come out of this. I mean, everybody knows that if you work with smallpox virus you can get it, or the AIDs virus, you can get it. There have been laboratory infections. But to say that this... this DNA cloned from this organism is dangerous was actually beyond scientific belief. > > Many of the objections to this... there were realistic things which covered what we could call the workforce in the laboratory. And in fact we chose actually to push everything in that direction because that was something tangible and you could actually get... get moving in that field. > > Well, what I thought was very difficult to deal with is something that I think comes up with science in general and is impossible, namely **the disaster scenarios, the catastrophe scenarios**. Someone like Chargaff came out and said: 'You are tampering with evolution and we don't know what's going to happen'. Now, I mean, how on earth can you ask scientists to be responsible for something that might happen 10 million years in the future? I mean, this is ludicrous, people can't actually be responsible for something that will happen next month. But the whole idea that we should say, yes, we can see that if we do this there is a possibility, however small, as they put it, that in 10 million years we humans will be supplanted by cats and therefore we'd better not do it. This... this is just not the way to deal with the world, or with science, for that matter. > > It also had very complicated issues about the so-called **responsibility of scientists**, which I've never believed. I think that what people should do is in fact to act as in fact good social... people, as individuals, but as a group scientists seem to me to not to have some special social responsibility. And of course that has... came from the atom bomb. But in studying the history there, once you open Pandora's Box, so the argument goes, then everything gets let loose. Therefore the argument is never let the scientists open Pandora's Box. That is, kill it in the laboratories. Because once it's out, society is... is incompetent or unable to deal with it. But that means that... I mean, I once gave a lecture on **the social irresponsibility of society**, because that seems to me to be the issue behind that. > > The people, as I said in this lecture, the people polluting the universe aren't the scientists but everybody's mother in the audience, you know, with detergents and so on. And how does everybody's mother get hold of detergents? That's because there are companies who manufacture this, and of course it is a possibility that for the chap that first synthesised dodecyl... dodecyl sulphonate, had he had the sense to envisage in the future that there would be 10 million people putting this in their dishwashers, he might have said, well I'd better not publish this, and better not let it out because I can see, you know, a hundred years' time everything will... will be... will be wrong. > > So I mean, this kind of... this kind of thing just makes it ludicrous. And the important thing is that **science I think is neutral in that sense. If the box can be opened it will be opened. If not now, then later. If not by us, then by other people.** And the only thing to do is to forbid the search for any new knowledge. You can't just forbid the search for that kind of new knowledge and not for any other kind, because it's part of the process. Now it seems to me that people had better get on to the real question, which is what do you do with it once you get it? And it's not up to us to say, we are to blame, *mea culpa*, we'll stop doing this, we promise we'll never clone another gene. Because I mean, you would lose a lot from this, as we've now known.","section":184,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.08824377624159048,-0.019609728053686774,0.009804864026843387,0,0,-0.009804864026843387,0,0,0.019609728053686774,0,0,0,0.009804864026843387,-0.058829184161060324,0.009804864026843387,-0.009804864026843387,0,-0.009804864026843387,0.06863404818790371,0,0.09804864026843386,0,0,-0.03921945610737355,0,-0.029414592080530162,0.029414592080530162,-0.009804864026843387,0.5490723855032297,0,0.009804864026843387,0,0,-0.029414592080530162,0.019609728053686774,0,0.26473132872477145,-0.019609728053686774,0.2353167366442413,0,0.019609728053686774,-0.04902432013421693,0,0,0.009804864026843387,0,0,0,0.019609728053686774,0,0.009804864026843387,0,0,-0.009804864026843387,0.019609728053686774,-0.009804864026843387,0,0,0.009804864026843387,0,0,-0.029414592080530162,0.009804864026843387,0,0,-0.03921945610737355,0,-0.03921945610737355,0.04902432013421693,-0.009804864026843387,0,0,0,-0.009804864026843387,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04902432013421693,-0.009804864026843387,0.029414592080530162,0,0.009804864026843387,-0.009804864026843387,0,-0.009804864026843387,0.019609728053686774,0,0,-0.04902432013421693,0,0,0,-0.009804864026843387,0.009804864026843387,-0.009804864026843387,0.03921945610737355,0,0.009804864026843387,-0.009804864026843387,0.009804864026843387,-0.009804864026843387,0.009804864026843387,-0.009804864026843387,0.009804864026843387,0,0,0,0,-0.04902432013421693,0.019609728053686774,0,0.009804864026843387,-0.009804864026843387,0.009804864026843387,-0.029414592080530162,0,-0.029414592080530162,0,0,0.029414592080530162,-0.029414592080530162,0,0,0,0,0,-0.22551187261739788,0.009804864026843387,0,0.058829184161060324,0,0.019609728053686774,0,0,-0.058829184161060324,0,-0.019609728053686774,0.0784389122147471,-0.06863404818790371,0,-0.0784389122147471,0.0784389122147471,-0.019609728053686774,0,-0.019609728053686774,0,0,0.029414592080530162,0,0,0,0,-0.029414592080530162,0.009804864026843387,-0.009804864026843387,0.18629241651002434,0,0.058829184161060324,0,0.019609728053686774,0,0,-0.019609728053686774,0,-0.04902432013421693,0.009804864026843387,-0.029414592080530162,0.04902432013421693,0,0.32356051288583176,-0.019609728053686774,0,0,0.009804864026843387,0,0.009804864026843387,0,0.029414592080530162,0,0.009804864026843387,0,0.009804864026843387,0,0,-0.009804864026843387,0,-0.03921945610737355,0.019609728053686774,0,0.058829184161060324,0,0.029414592080530162,0,0.019609728053686774,-0.019609728053686774,0,0,0.009804864026843387,-0.029414592080530162,0,-0.009804864026843387,0.019609728053686774,-0.029414592080530162,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.029414592080530162,0,0.009804864026843387,-0.09804864026843386,0,0,0,-0.0784389122147471,0,-0.06863404818790371,0,-0.0784389122147471,0.009804864026843387,0,0.009804864026843387,0,0.009804864026843387,-0.10785350429527725,0,0,0.019609728053686774,0,0,-0.029414592080530162,0,0,0.009804864026843387,0,0,-0.009804864026843387,0.0784389122147471,-0.019609728053686774,0,-0.029414592080530162,0.009804864026843387,-0.029414592080530162,0,0,0,0,0,-0.009804864026843387,0.009804864026843387,-0.058829184161060324,0,0,0,-0.009804864026843387,0.009804864026843387,0,0.04902432013421693,0,0.009804864026843387,-0.009804864026843387,0.08824377624159048,-0.009804864026843387,0.009804864026843387,-0.03921945610737355,0.009804864026843387,-0.03921945610737355,0.2157070085905545,-0.03921945610737355,0.009804864026843387,0,0.009804864026843387,-0.16668268845633757,0.009804864026843387,0,0.009804864026843387,-0.019609728053686774,0,0,0.03921945610737355,0,0.009804864026843387,0,0.029414592080530162,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.13726809637580742,0.019609728053686774,-0.009804864026843387,0,0,0,-0.058829184161060324,0.009804864026843387,0,0.029414592080530162,0,0.009804864026843387,0,0.029414592080530162,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.009804864026843387,0,-0.03921945610737355,0,-0.009804864026843387,0,-0.029414592080530162,0.04902432013421693,-0.009804864026843387,0,0,0,-0.009804864026843387,0,0,0,-0.029414592080530162,0,0,0,0,0.019609728053686774,0,0.058829184161060324,0,0,0,0.058829184161060324,-0.019609728053686774,0,0,0,-0.009804864026843387,0.019609728053686774,0,0.06863404818790371,-0.009804864026843387,0.029414592080530162,-0.04902432013421693,0.029414592080530162,-0.009804864026843387,0,-0.019609728053686774,0.22551187261739788,-0.08824377624159048,0,-0.058829184161060324,0,-0.019609728053686774,0.08824377624159048,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04902432013421693,-0.04902432013421693,0.009804864026843387,0,0.019609728053686774,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-185-1","text":"> Part of my work became to really try to get the science moving.

And that once I got it accustomed to live in heavy water it wouldn't be able to live anywhere in the present universe, because heavy water was only invented in 1935 in Chicago. Invented, I mean, obtained in pure form. > > So I've actually grown... I actually grew bacteria for thousands of generations in heavy water. They adapted and there's quite an interesting story in evolution there still to... to come to its fruition, but alas they could always grow back in light water. But I would have thought that would be the absolutely safe strain, that it would only know this kind of particular chemical universe. It would have made the work very expensive and people like the Norwegian Electricity Company very rich because everybody would have had to use heavy water. > > But I did create a safe strain. It taught me a lot of lessons about this whole technology, because it's extremely difficult to do genetic engineering. Everybody thinks you just kind of toss it off and everything works. **It's extremely difficult to attain an end on this. Most of the time it's like the television set, it doesn't work. If you tamper with a television set you tend to break it most of the time rather than do something new.** > > And so we finally did create a thing and I had to test it. And of course **I tested it on myself**. Now, as you know, human experimentation is strictly forbidden, and so I said I'm testing it on an upper primate, I didn't say it was a human being. In fact I don't count myself necessarily as one. I was then told I should consult people before I did this experiment. They couldn't stop me, but I should consult people. So I sort of met odd people in the street and said what do you think about this? However, I did the experiment; it was a very good experiment. I put... I showed my safe... my strain was **10 million times safer**.","section":185,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.041389154358371115,0,0,0,0,-0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.041389154358371115,0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,0.06208373153755667,0,0.08277830871674223,-0.020694577179185557,0,-0.10347288589592779,0,0,0.020694577179185557,-0.020694577179185557,0.37250238922534,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0,-0.08277830871674223,0.020694577179185557,-0.020694577179185557,0.2690295033294122,0,0.2897240805085978,-0.020694577179185557,0,-0.06208373153755667,0,-0.041389154358371115,0,0,0.020694577179185557,-0.020694577179185557,0.020694577179185557,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,0.041389154358371115,0,0,-0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,0,0.18625119461267,-0.041389154358371115,0.10347288589592779,-0.020694577179185557,0,-0.041389154358371115,0.020694577179185557,0,0,-0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06208373153755667,-0.020694577179185557,0.06208373153755667,0,0.041389154358371115,0,0,0,0.12416746307511334,0,0,-0.020694577179185557,0,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0.06208373153755667,-0.020694577179185557,0,-0.020694577179185557,0,-0.041389154358371115,0.06208373153755667,-0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.041389154358371115,0.12416746307511334,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0.041389154358371115,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,0.041389154358371115,-0.06208373153755667,0,0,0,0,0,-0.16555661743348446,0,-0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,0,0.041389154358371115,0,0,0,0.10347288589592779,0,0.020694577179185557,-0.020694577179185557,0.1448620402542989,0,0,-0.08277830871674223,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.020694577179185557,0.2690295033294122,0,0.06208373153755667,0,0,-0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,-0.06208373153755667,0,0,0.041389154358371115,0,0.06208373153755667,-0.020694577179185557,0,-0.08277830871674223,0,0,0,0,0.020694577179185557,-0.020694577179185557,0.041389154358371115,0,0,0,0,-0.020694577179185557,0,-0.020694577179185557,0.06208373153755667,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06208373153755667,0,0,0,0,0,-0.041389154358371115,0,0,0.020694577179185557,-0.08277830871674223,0,-0.10347288589592779,0,-0.041389154358371115,0,0,0,-0.020694577179185557,0.020694577179185557,-0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,-0.020694577179185557,0.020694577179185557,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0.041389154358371115,0,0.06208373153755667,-0.020694577179185557,0.16555661743348446,0,0,-0.020694577179185557,0,-0.020694577179185557,0,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,0.020694577179185557,-0.10347288589592779,0.020694577179185557,-0.020694577179185557,0,-0.06208373153755667,0,0,0.041389154358371115,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0.35180781204615447,-0.020694577179185557,0.020694577179185557,0,0.020694577179185557,-0.041389154358371115,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.041389154358371115,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.020694577179185557,0,0,0.020694577179185557,-0.06208373153755667,0.06208373153755667,0,0,-0.020694577179185557,0,-0.041389154358371115,0,0,0.06208373153755667,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0.020694577179185557,-0.020694577179185557,0,-0.020694577179185557,0,0,0.020694577179185557,-0.041389154358371115,0.020694577179185557,-0.06208373153755667,0,0,0,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0,-0.041389154358371115,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0,0,0.06208373153755667,-0.020694577179185557,0,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0.020694577179185557,0,0.12416746307511334,0,0.10347288589592779,0,0,0,0.2897240805085978,-0.06208373153755667,0,-0.020694577179185557,0.020694577179185557,-0.020694577179185557,0.08277830871674223,0,0,0,0,0,0.06208373153755667,0,0.06208373153755667,-0.06208373153755667,0.041389154358371115,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-186-1","text":"> The best case to take a dangerous virus is to take it and clone it; that would make it safe.

And I had made contact with the people that were interested in starting the Human Genome Programme. In fact, when Bob Sinsheimer had his first meeting in 1984, I couldn't go to that and sent two people from the lab. But they had a repeat of that in '85 at Santa Fe and I went to that.

That got quite far, John Sulston joined me in this bacteria mapping, and then he decided he would try and apply the technology we developed to *C. elegans*. And the *C. elegans* project then grew into an enormous genome project which is now with aims of sequencing the entire genome. > > I decided that I would go for the human genome. Now, the reasons for that is that I think if we've got to do this amount of work on an animal, one animal, then let's choose the animal that's of most interest. And from this egocentric point of view I think man is extremely interesting. The point is that **you are no longer conditioned by experimental constraints**. When we did classical experimental genetics we had to go through endless selections to get an organism that fitted into the window of the electron microscope, or that would grow rapidly in a laboratory, or that and that you could freeze, and had the appropriate life cycle that you could do experiments with. And this throughout the whole of this made enormous constraints about what you could choose, and that half of the art of choosing was in fact a piece of science in its own right, so that one could get something started in this way.","section":191,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.052574972792458624,0,0,0,0,-0.01752499093081954,0,-0.01752499093081954,0.01752499093081954,-0.01752499093081954,0,-0.03504998186163908,0,-0.03504998186163908,0.01752499093081954,0,0,0,0.12267493651573678,-0.01752499093081954,0.052574972792458624,-0.01752499093081954,0,-0.052574972792458624,0,-0.052574972792458624,0.01752499093081954,-0.01752499093081954,0.5432747188554058,-0.01752499093081954,0,-0.03504998186163908,0,0,0,-0.03504998186163908,0.22782488210065402,0,0.2628748639622931,0,0,-0.01752499093081954,0.01752499093081954,0,0,0,0,-0.03504998186163908,0,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0,-0.01752499093081954,0.03504998186163908,-0.052574972792458624,0,-0.01752499093081954,0,0,0.03504998186163908,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01752499093081954,0,0,0,0,0.07009996372327816,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.052574972792458624,0,-0.052574972792458624,0,-0.052574972792458624,0.0876249546540977,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0,0,0.052574972792458624,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03504998186163908,0,0,0,-0.01752499093081954,0.12267493651573678,0,0,0,0,0,0.07009996372327816,0,0,0,0,-0.01752499093081954,0,-0.15772491837737587,0.01752499093081954,0,0.03504998186163908,-0.01752499093081954,0,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0.03504998186163908,0,0.052574972792458624,-0.03504998186163908,0,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.22782488210065402,0,0,0,0,-0.07009996372327816,0,0,0,-0.01752499093081954,0,-0.03504998186163908,0,0,0.40307479140884944,-0.03504998186163908,0.01752499093081954,-0.01752499093081954,0,-0.052574972792458624,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03504998186163908,0.12267493651573678,-0.01752499093081954,0.01752499093081954,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0,0,0,-0.01752499093081954,0.01752499093081954,-0.01752499093081954,0.01752499093081954,-0.01752499093081954,0,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0,-0.01752499093081954,0.01752499093081954,0,0.03504998186163908,-0.03504998186163908,0,0,0.03504998186163908,-0.01752499093081954,0,-0.03504998186163908,0,-0.01752499093081954,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01752499093081954,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01752499093081954,0.01752499093081954,-0.03504998186163908,0.03504998186163908,0,0,-0.0876249546540977,0.01752499093081954,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0.01752499093081954,-0.01752499093081954,0,0,0,-0.03504998186163908,0,0,0,0,0.052574972792458624,-0.01752499093081954,0.01752499093081954,0,0.03504998186163908,-0.01752499093081954,0.01752499093081954,0,0,-0.01752499093081954,0.01752499093081954,0,0.07009996372327816,-0.03504998186163908,0.03504998186163908,0,0,-0.12267493651573678,0.01752499093081954,0,0,-0.03504998186163908,0,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0.03504998186163908,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.12267493651573678,0,-0.01752499093081954,0,0,0,-0.03504998186163908,0,0,0.01752499093081954,-0.07009996372327816,0,0,0.0876249546540977,0,0,0,0,-0.01752499093081954,0,0,0.052574972792458624,-0.03504998186163908,0.03504998186163908,-0.03504998186163908,0,-0.03504998186163908,0,-0.07009996372327816,0,-0.01752499093081954,0,-0.01752499093081954,0,-0.07009996372327816,0.01752499093081954,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0,0,0,-0.03504998186163908,0,0,0,0,0.03504998186163908,-0.052574972792458624,0,0,0,-0.03504998186163908,0.01752499093081954,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0.0876249546540977,-0.01752499093081954,0.0876249546540977,-0.01752499093081954,0,0,0.28039985489311264,-0.052574972792458624,0,-0.01752499093081954,0,0,0.052574972792458624,0,0,-0.01752499093081954,0.01752499093081954,0,0,0,0.07009996372327816,-0.052574972792458624,0,0,0.01752499093081954,0,0,0,0,-0.01752499093081954]},{"id":"transcript-192-1","text":"> When I started the *C. elegans* [*Caenorhabditis elegans*] I was almost 40 then; many of my colleagues were thinking of retiring, you know, into administration and things like that. In fact, the first mutant was got just before my 41st birthday, so I was 40 when we got the first mutant. And I worked in *C. elegans* for — extensively and personally — for... for another 10 years, having started it way back in 1963. And of course I then decided to give it up. > > Well, that's simply because there were lots of people doing it and they were far more competent at doing what needed to be done than I was. I mean, we did continue till the early '80s, but basically my mind was going somewhere else. > > The main reason is that... **Bernal once said that people in science... he compared science to a chess game**. And he said there's the opening game, there's the mid game, middle game, and the end game. Of course, very few people get a chance to play the end game, and most people are in the middle game. But **I find the most wonderful thing in science is the opening game**, when everything's... there's nothing else there and that's when I think you can exercise also a tremendous amount of freedom of choice, and freedom of intellectual choice as well. Bernal himself was extremely good at the opening game. And I think that's the challenge, and so having played the opening game with *C. elegans*, and it was now in the middle game where there were lots of people, you know, taking pawns and moving knights around the board, I thought: better go and find somewhere else to play another game. > > And that's essentially what I've done, and of course you might think that in effect... I did think that the age of nearly 60 was probably not a good time to start science, but in fact it is. I like to think that people who... who get to be the age of 60 already know too much about the subjects they've worked in at any stage to be of any use to it. Because **I've always been a strong believer in the value of ignorance**. And so, therefore, I think that when you know too much you're dangerous in the subject because you will deter originality in others. And therefore, **the big thing is to get out of it and go and look for something else to do**. > > And also, when you get to the age of 60, it's very useful, you begin to forget things, and so, therefore, your knowledge is decaying all the time. And that's also quite useful. It's, it's also quite dangerous in fact, because you find yourself doing things that you did actually 15 years ago and forgot about and actually go through it again and rediscover it. So that, I think, is the, is the interesting thing, that's why I think **people should change their subjects very frequently**, and why I think the best scientists do that.","section":192,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.041431563816242724,0,0,-0.013810521272080907,0,-0.013810521272080907,0,-0.1657262552649709,0.041431563816242724,0,0,0,0,-0.013810521272080907,0,-0.027621042544161815,0,0,0.027621042544161815,0,0.05524208508832363,0,0,-0.12429469144872816,0.041431563816242724,0,0.013810521272080907,0,0.5524208508832363,0,0,-0.027621042544161815,0,-0.041431563816242724,0.027621042544161815,0,0.1933472978091327,0,0.4005051168903463,-0.013810521272080907,0,-0.027621042544161815,0,-0.013810521272080907,0.013810521272080907,0,0,-0.027621042544161815,0,0,0,0,0.027621042544161815,0,0,0,0,-0.041431563816242724,0,0,0,-0.027621042544161815,0.09667364890456635,0,0,-0.027621042544161815,0,0,0.027621042544161815,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.013810521272080907,-0.013810521272080907,0,-0.027621042544161815,0,0,0,0,0.027621042544161815,0,0,0,0,-0.12429469144872816,0.027621042544161815,0,0,-0.027621042544161815,0.027621042544161815,-0.013810521272080907,0,0,0,-0.013810521272080907,0,-0.013810521272080907,0,0,0,0,0.013810521272080907,0,0,0,0.013810521272080907,0,0.013810521272080907,0,0.027621042544161815,0,0,-0.05524208508832363,0,0,0.013810521272080907,-0.013810521272080907,0,0,0.013810521272080907,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.013810521272080907,-0.027621042544161815,0.013810521272080907,0,0.05524208508832363,-0.013810521272080907,0,-0.05524208508832363,0.05524208508832363,-0.027621042544161815,0,-0.041431563816242724,0,0,0.013810521272080907,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1933472978091327,0,0.013810521272080907,0,0.013810521272080907,-0.013810521272080907,0,0,0,-0.013810521272080907,0,0,0.05524208508832363,0,0.27621042544161817,-0.041431563816242724,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05524208508832363,0,0.027621042544161815,-0.013810521272080907,0,0,0,-0.041431563816242724,0.013810521272080907,-0.06905260636040454,0.013810521272080907,-0.013810521272080907,0,-0.013810521272080907,0,0,0.05524208508832363,0,0,-0.013810521272080907,0.013810521272080907,-0.013810521272080907,0,0,0,-0.013810521272080907,0.013810521272080907,-0.013810521272080907,0,0,0,0,0,-0.013810521272080907,0,-0.05524208508832363,0,0,0,-0.05524208508832363,0,-0.09667364890456635,0,-0.027621042544161815,0,-0.027621042544161815,0,0,0,-0.013810521272080907,0,0,0.013810521272080907,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.013810521272080907,0.05524208508832363,0,0.11048417017664726,-0.027621042544161815,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.013810521272080907,-0.013810521272080907,0.027621042544161815,0,0.013810521272080907,-0.027621042544161815,0,0,0,0,0.041431563816242724,0,0,0,0.013810521272080907,0,0.013810521272080907,-0.013810521272080907,0,-0.013810521272080907,0,-0.027621042544161815,0.1657262552649709,0,0,0,0,-0.11048417017664726,0,0,0,-0.09667364890456635,0,0,0.08286312763248545,0,0.027621042544161815,0,0.013810521272080907,0,0,0,0,-0.027621042544161815,0,0,0.013810521272080907,-0.05524208508832363,0.05524208508832363,0,0,0,0,-0.041431563816242724,0,0,0.027621042544161815,0,0,0,0.027621042544161815,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.027621042544161815,0,-0.041431563816242724,0,-0.013810521272080907,0,-0.013810521272080907,0.027621042544161815,0,0,0,0,-0.013810521272080907,0.013810521272080907,-0.041431563816242724,0,-0.027621042544161815,0,-0.013810521272080907,0.013810521272080907,-0.027621042544161815,0.06905260636040454,0,0.027621042544161815,0,0,0,0.08286312763248545,0,0.05524208508832363,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.027621042544161815,0.013810521272080907,-0.027621042544161815,0.05524208508832363,0,0,0,0.31764198925786086,-0.013810521272080907,0,-0.027621042544161815,0.013810521272080907,0,0.11048417017664726,0,0,-0.027621042544161815,0.013810521272080907,0,0.013810521272080907,0,0.027621042544161815,-0.027621042544161815,0,-0.013810521272080907,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-193-1","text":"> The choice of the problem to work on — after we thought that all the general outline of molecular biology had been accomplished — that was one of the things that Francis and I started talking about in the early '60s.

And in 1962 there still remained a tremendous task to understand the structure and function of the ribosome, to understand transfer RNA, to understand how activating enzymes work. And you could have written a program if you wanted to, which would involve a huge study of, let us say, the ribosome and the mechanism of protein synthesis. And that would involve purifying ribosomes, trying to crystallise them, getting all their protein components, sequencing all the proteins, getting all the transfer RNAs, separating them, finding all the activating enzymes and reducing it then to the molecular level. > > And **that we thought we didn't want to do**, although our laboratory, our institute at that... point had all the capability of doing it. If you like, **that was a kind of project research** in which you could... a general could, so to speak, plan a campaign and then just get, you know, the cavalry to do this and the artillery to do that. And **that didn't seem to me to be what one wants to do in science**. > > There was of course at the time also a... a great feeling that it was essentially all over. This was about the time that Gunther Stent had written this famous paper, the rough... I forget its title, but it used to be called by us *The End of Molecular Biology*. It was part of a more general thing that he wrote, which was *The End of Everything* [sic], basically. > > But one felt that **one had to go to problems that I think were challenging**, and my view was that we had to go back to the problems that faced Thomas Morgan.","section":193,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.04803228855050661,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04803228855050661,-0.01601076285016887,0.01601076285016887,-0.03202152570033774,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09606457710101322,0,0.08005381425084435,-0.01601076285016887,0,-0.03202152570033774,0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0.6084089883064171,0,0,-0.01601076285016887,0,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0.35223678270371517,-0.01601076285016887,0.25617220560270193,-0.01601076285016887,0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0,-0.01601076285016887,0.01601076285016887,0,0.04803228855050661,0,0,-0.04803228855050661,0,0,0,0,0.04803228855050661,0,0.04803228855050661,0,0,-0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0,0.01601076285016887,-0.04803228855050661,0.03202152570033774,-0.01601076285016887,0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0.03202152570033774,-0.01601076285016887,0.01601076285016887,0,0,-0.03202152570033774,0.01601076285016887,0,0,-0.01601076285016887,0.04803228855050661,-0.06404305140067548,0.04803228855050661,-0.03202152570033774,0,0,0,-0.01601076285016887,0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0,0,0.01601076285016887,-0.06404305140067548,0.03202152570033774,-0.01601076285016887,0.04803228855050661,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01601076285016887,-0.04803228855050661,0,0,0,0,0.04803228855050661,-0.04803228855050661,0,0,0,-0.01601076285016887,0.03202152570033774,0,0,-0.04803228855050661,0.01601076285016887,0,0.08005381425084435,0,0,-0.03202152570033774,0,-0.03202152570033774,0.01601076285016887,-0.01601076285016887,0,-0.01601076285016887,0,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0,0,0.09606457710101322,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0.03202152570033774,0,0,-0.01601076285016887,0,0,0.01601076285016887,-0.06404305140067548,0.4162798341043906,0,0.01601076285016887,-0.01601076285016887,0.01601076285016887,0,0,-0.01601076285016887,0.03202152570033774,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0,-0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,-0.01601076285016887,0.04803228855050661,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0,-0.03202152570033774,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01601076285016887,0,-0.01601076285016887,0,-0.01601076285016887,0,-0.01601076285016887,0,-0.03202152570033774,0,-0.03202152570033774,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03202152570033774,0,-0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04803228855050661,0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0,0,0.1601076285016887,-0.01601076285016887,0,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0.03202152570033774,0,0,0,0,-0.06404305140067548,0.01601076285016887,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0.03202152570033774,0,0.01601076285016887,-0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,-0.03202152570033774,0,0,0.09606457710101322,0,0,-0.03202152570033774,0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0,-0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.12808610280135097,0.03202152570033774,0,0,0,0,-0.04803228855050661,0,-0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03202152570033774,0.01601076285016887,-0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,-0.03202152570033774,0.1120753399511821,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0,-0.03202152570033774,0,0,0,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0.08005381425084435,0,0,0,0,0,0.01601076285016887,-0.04803228855050661,0,0,0,-0.01601076285016887,0,-0.01601076285016887,0.03202152570033774,0,0.06404305140067548,-0.01601076285016887,0.04803228855050661,0,0,0,0.2241506799023642,-0.04803228855050661,0,0,0.01601076285016887,0,0.03202152570033774,0,0,-0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0,0.04803228855050661,-0.01601076285016887,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-194-1","text":"> Thomas Morgan was an embryologist — Thomas Hunt Morgan — who had worked at the turn of the century in many subjects and had discovered that he'd come to the end of what he could do with classical embryological techniques.

You could say I'm interested in development or I'm interested in the nervous system, but nobody actually knew how you could do it. The classical technology, if I can put it, of development, was essentially **cut and splice**. You take a piece out of an embryo at one point and… at one part and you move it around to another part. And I can remember that… and of course you either note whether it changes or it doesn't change. If it alters, that is, takes up the properties of its new environment, then we call it that it's been regulated, and it wasn't determined. And a whole language had been developed, which I can remember reading through in the '40s with… with people, with Joe Gilman, reading… Needham's book, the *Biochemistry and Morphogenesis*, and being totally involved in really very detailed discussions on the difference between evocation and induction. It was tremendously hard to discover whether induction and evocation were really two different things or was one part of the other. And whether an evocator was something different from an inducer, and so on. And so we had no other approach then to cut and splice. > > Of course what we knew is, that we now had genes to contend with. We knew what they are. We knew that genes made proteins, and so that just said, well, let's get started in… into this and look at how genetics or genes will now affect our knowledge of embryology. > > I have to say also that the biochemical approach to development had totally fizzled out. The search for the inducer had gone on, lots of people had tried, there were lots of things that… that had worked. There were, there was a huge area of biochemistry in development which simply consisted in assaying enzymes in eggs and in tadpoles, and the… the connections weren't there. There was a lot of what I would call theoretical work, in fact a few books written by Waddington at the time on organisers and genes — a very interesting book — and ideas that genes really control rate processes, but **all of this had no body in it, it lacked… it lacked a material content and was simply verbalising our ignorance**. > > And having… and the way that I think Francis and I worked is that I kept on thinking is, what… what experimental system would one attempt to do this? And I remember saying well, what we should do is **decompose the problems of development into sub-problems**, and just see whether we can tackle these problems in an experimental way independently, because **the global problem is intractable at this time**. And we then decided to ask what were the questions that you could decompose it into. So one of the questions was that… cell movement, it had become clear that I mean, cells move around and that cell movement may be an important thing in modelling… modelling the organs of… of animals. Polarity, which I think is still a very important problem, was in my mind the essential problem. You had to explain why one part of a cell became different from another. Why certain cells divided with certain planes of division, which of course one could see from all the classical descriptive embryology that polarity, I think, needed this explanation.","section":195,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.014125195547029415,0,0.02825039109405883,0,0,-0.014125195547029415,0.042375586641088245,0,0.08475117328217649,0,0,0,0,0,0.014125195547029415,0,0.014125195547029415,0,0.18362754211138238,0,0.12712675992326472,0,0.014125195547029415,-0.05650078218811766,0,-0.07062597773514707,0,0,0.409630670863853,0,0,-0.02825039109405883,0,-0.042375586641088245,0.042375586641088245,0,0.12712675992326472,-0.014125195547029415,0.409630670863853,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014125195547029415,0.05650078218811766,-0.014125195547029415,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05650078218811766,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02825039109405883,0.014125195547029415,0,0.014125195547029415,0,0,0,0,0,0.014125195547029415,0,0.042375586641088245,-0.014125195547029415,0,0,0.02825039109405883,0,0.07062597773514707,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.042375586641088245,0.07062597773514707,0,0.014125195547029415,-0.014125195547029415,0.014125195547029415,0,0.05650078218811766,0,0,0,0.0988763688292059,0,0.014125195547029415,-0.02825039109405883,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11300156437623532,0,0,0,0,0.014125195547029415,-0.07062597773514707,0,0,0,0,0.014125195547029415,-0.02825039109405883,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07062597773514707,0,0,0.05650078218811766,-0.014125195547029415,0.014125195547029415,0,0.014125195547029415,-0.02825039109405883,0,0,0.05650078218811766,-0.014125195547029415,0,-0.014125195547029415,0.042375586641088245,-0.07062597773514707,0,-0.014125195547029415,0,0,0.014125195547029415,0,0.02825039109405883,0,0,0,0,0,0.24012832429950004,0,0,0,0,-0.042375586641088245,0,-0.02825039109405883,0,0,0,-0.05650078218811766,0,0,0.31075430203464716,-0.014125195547029415,0.02825039109405883,-0.042375586641088245,0,0,0,-0.014125195547029415,0.0988763688292059,-0.042375586641088245,0.014125195547029415,0,0.02825039109405883,0,0,0,0,-0.02825039109405883,0.05650078218811766,-0.014125195547029415,0.02825039109405883,0,0,0,0.02825039109405883,0,0,0,0.02825039109405883,-0.014125195547029415,0,0,0,-0.02825039109405883,0.014125195547029415,0,0,-0.014125195547029415,0,-0.014125195547029415,0,-0.02825039109405883,0,-0.014125195547029415,0.02825039109405883,0,0,-0.014125195547029415,0.014125195547029415,-0.08475117328217649,0,-0.05650078218811766,0,-0.02825039109405883,0,0,0,-0.05650078218811766,0,-0.014125195547029415,0,0,0.014125195547029415,0,0,0,0.014125195547029415,-0.014125195547029415,0.014125195547029415,0,0.12712675992326472,0,0,-0.05650078218811766,0,0,0,0,0.02825039109405883,-0.05650078218811766,0,-0.042375586641088245,0,-0.014125195547029415,0.014125195547029415,-0.014125195547029415,0,0,0,-0.014125195547029415,0.02825039109405883,0,0.02825039109405883,-0.014125195547029415,0,0,0,-0.02825039109405883,0,-0.014125195547029415,0.21187793320544124,-0.02825039109405883,0.042375586641088245,0,0.07062597773514707,-0.11300156437623532,0,0,0,-0.014125195547029415,0.014125195547029415,-0.014125195547029415,0.042375586641088245,0,0.02825039109405883,0,0.014125195547029415,0,0.014125195547029415,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.15537715101732358,0.014125195547029415,-0.014125195547029415,0,0,0.05650078218811766,-0.0988763688292059,0,0,0.02825039109405883,0,0,0,0.014125195547029415,0,0,-0.02825039109405883,0,0,0,-0.02825039109405883,0,-0.014125195547029415,0.014125195547029415,0,0.014125195547029415,-0.05650078218811766,0.02825039109405883,-0.014125195547029415,0,0,0.014125195547029415,-0.042375586641088245,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.042375586641088245,0,0.014125195547029415,-0.014125195547029415,0.014125195547029415,0,0.05650078218811766,-0.02825039109405883,0,0,0.014125195547029415,0,0,0,0.042375586641088245,-0.02825039109405883,0.14125195547029415,0,0.05650078218811766,0,0,0,0.31075430203464716,-0.07062597773514707,0.0988763688292059,-0.042375586641088245,0,-0.014125195547029415,0.02825039109405883,-0.014125195547029415,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.042375586641088245,-0.02825039109405883,0.014125195547029415,-0.014125195547029415,0.042375586641088245,0,0.014125195547029415,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-196-1","text":"> Nobody seemed to be very interested in connecting up development with the genes. There was a complete gap between these. And when people began to think about this and began to think that perhaps genes... how, in what sense could genes be considered the units of development, it became clear that that was a non-question. **The units of development are cells. And our job is to ask how do genes get hold of the cells**, if I can put it in that way. Because that's the way the genes must go through to the developmental process, and indeed to all the complex phenotypes of organisms. They have to get hold of the construction machinery of these... of the organs in order to express their effects. > > However, the gradients was very interesting, because what impressed Francis is that he made a quick calculation about the sizes of these things. He didn't know the sizes of imaginal discs, so he quickly looked them up, and he made a calculation which is really what Francis is very good at, as to whether **diffusion of an average sized small molecule could account for the results** because that would... could only operate at a certain scale. That is, it would be very hard... it would take too long to establish something by diffusion if, let us say, it was 10 feet wide. And you wouldn't want to do this if it was just, let us say, 100Å. But this was in the scale of sizes that... that could be done by diffusion. > > And so Francis got very interested in asking whether you could account for positional information that Lewis was discussing in terms of a process of diffusion. So one had a very simple model then which was that one had a... a source — that is some cells that created this soon became a **diffusible morphogen** — and you had a sink at the other end and this molecule distributed itself at a... in the form of a gradient across this. And then the idea was that **the cells would read this gradient and decide what it is they were going to be**. And so you had a lot of discussions as to whether... of course you then had to have set a threshold in each of the groups of cells and of course you can ask how accurate you can do this.","section":196,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.09452488316967972,0,0,0,0,-0.018904976633935942,0.018904976633935942,-0.018904976633935942,0.07561990653574377,0,0,0,0,-0.037809953267871885,0.037809953267871885,0,0,0,0.1323348364375516,0,0.09452488316967972,-0.037809953267871885,0,-0.09452488316967972,0,-0.11342985980361565,0.018904976633935942,0,0.5104343691162705,0,0,-0.07561990653574377,0,-0.11342985980361565,0,0,0.28357464950903916,-0.037809953267871885,0.24576469624116726,0,0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0.018904976633935942,0,0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018904976633935942,0,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0.018904976633935942,0,0.037809953267871885,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.037809953267871885,0.037809953267871885,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0.018904976633935942,-0.037809953267871885,0.018904976633935942,0,0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0.05671492990180783,-0.018904976633935942,0,-0.018904976633935942,0.018904976633935942,-0.018904976633935942,0,-0.018904976633935942,0.037809953267871885,0,0,0,0,-0.05671492990180783,0.018904976633935942,-0.037809953267871885,0,0,0,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0.018904976633935942,0,0.037809953267871885,-0.037809953267871885,0.018904976633935942,0,0,-0.018904976633935942,0,-0.15123981307148754,0,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.037809953267871885,0,0,0,0.037809953267871885,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.037809953267871885,-0.018904976633935942,0.1701447897054235,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018904976633935942,0.018904976633935942,0,0.018904976633935942,-0.018904976633935942,0.3024796261429751,-0.018904976633935942,0,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0,0.018904976633935942,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0.037809953267871885,0,0,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0.09452488316967972,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0.037809953267871885,0,0.018904976633935942,0,0,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0,0,-0.037809953267871885,0,0,0,-0.037809953267871885,0,0,0,-0.05671492990180783,0.037809953267871885,-0.018904976633935942,0,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0,0.018904976633935942,-0.05671492990180783,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.037809953267871885,0.018904976633935942,-0.018904976633935942,0,-0.018904976633935942,0.1701447897054235,0,0,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0,0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0,-0.037809953267871885,0,0,0.018904976633935942,-0.018904976633935942,0.07561990653574377,0,0.05671492990180783,-0.018904976633935942,0.05671492990180783,0,0,0,0.018904976633935942,-0.07561990653574377,0,0,0.1323348364375516,0,0.037809953267871885,0,0,-0.1323348364375516,0.018904976633935942,-0.037809953267871885,0,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0.037809953267871885,0,0,0,0.037809953267871885,-0.018904976633935942,0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0,-0.018904976633935942,0.037809953267871885,0,0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0,-0.07561990653574377,0,0,0.09452488316967972,0,0,0,0.09452488316967972,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.037809953267871885,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018904976633935942,0.05671492990180783,0,0.11342985980361565,-0.037809953267871885,0,0,0.037809953267871885,0,0,0,0.037809953267871885,0,0.1323348364375516,0,0.037809953267871885,0,0,0,0.3591945560447829,-0.018904976633935942,0.05671492990180783,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0.037809953267871885,-0.018904976633935942,0,-0.018904976633935942,0.018904976633935942,0,0,0,0.05671492990180783,-0.018904976633935942,0,0,0.037809953267871885,-0.018904976633935942,0.018904976633935942,-0.05671492990180783,0,-0.018904976633935942]},{"id":"transcript-197-1","text":"> It is a remarkable fact, but I actually owned a copy of **Turing's paper**, which in fact I wrote and got from him when it pub… was published in The Royal Society; because I'd known of course Turing's name from computing, via the von Neumann.

And of course it's a very interesting paper because it's… if you could think of **Turing as being the archdeacon of digital computation**, which he was in his Turing machine and in everything that followed in computers; **this stuff was exactly the opposite. It is essentially an analogue computation**, and that's an analogue computation with thresholds, and the sort of thing that cells are, and objects, are very good at doing. > > And of course it is interesting that… that this separation between digital and analogue thinking really swept through biological sciences and I think a lot of the analogue computation was just forgotten, because of the… I think for a lot of things like — computers were digital, genetic programs were like computer programs — it's all this kind of thinking by metaphor or thinking by similarity, by analogy, that I think confused a lot of people. Because **biological systems have worked out extremely good ways of doing analogue computation within their scales**, and do it exceedingly well. And in fact, **they find it very difficult to count things beyond one. They can count the difference between one and nought.** > > And so… I think that Turing then had shown that there's an engineering solution, if I can put it that way. And it is interesting that Lewis himself had been trained as an engineer and so this I think did come naturally to him, that this is a… this is the kind of machinery that doesn't count but has thresholds and has flows and… and organises things in that way.","section":197,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,-0.08713128900943559,0,0,0.03485251560377424,0,0,0,0,-0.05227877340566136,0,0,0,0,0.06970503120754848,0,0.08713128900943559,0,0.03485251560377424,-0.06970503120754848,0.03485251560377424,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0.2788201248301939,0,0,-0.03485251560377424,0,-0.10455754681132272,0,0,0.05227877340566136,0,0.4705089606509522,-0.01742625780188712,0,-0.05227877340566136,0.01742625780188712,-0.08713128900943559,0,0,0.03485251560377424,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,0.05227877340566136,-0.01742625780188712,0.03485251560377424,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03485251560377424,0.03485251560377424,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0,-0.03485251560377424,0.05227877340566136,-0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,0,0.03485251560377424,0,0,0,0,0,0.01742625780188712,-0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13941006241509696,0,0,-0.12198380461320985,0,0,0,-0.01742625780188712,0.03485251560377424,-0.01742625780188712,0.06970503120754848,0,0,0,0.06970503120754848,-0.03485251560377424,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01742625780188712,0.01742625780188712,-0.03485251560377424,0,-0.05227877340566136,0,-0.01742625780188712,0,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,0,-0.03485251560377424,0,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0,-0.17426257801887118,0,0,0.03485251560377424,0,0,0,0.01742625780188712,-0.03485251560377424,0,0,0.08713128900943559,0,0,-0.01742625780188712,0.03485251560377424,-0.03485251560377424,0.01742625780188712,-0.05227877340566136,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01742625780188712,0,0,0.17426257801887118,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,0,-0.03485251560377424,0,-0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,0,0.36595141383962954,-0.05227877340566136,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05227877340566136,0,0.03485251560377424,0,0.05227877340566136,-0.05227877340566136,0,0,0,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0.01742625780188712,-0.01742625780188712,0,0,0.05227877340566136,0,0,-0.06970503120754848,0,-0.03485251560377424,0,0,0,-0.03485251560377424,0,-0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01742625780188712,0.01742625780188712,-0.10455754681132272,0,-0.01742625780188712,0,-0.03485251560377424,0,-0.01742625780188712,0,0,0.01742625780188712,-0.03485251560377424,0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,0,-0.01742625780188712,0,0,0.03485251560377424,-0.01742625780188712,0,0,0.12198380461320985,0,0.01742625780188712,-0.05227877340566136,0,0,0,0,0.06970503120754848,-0.05227877340566136,0,0,0.03485251560377424,-0.08713128900943559,0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,0.05227877340566136,0,0.03485251560377424,0,0.05227877340566136,-0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,-0.01742625780188712,0,0,0.2439676092264197,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0.01742625780188712,-0.12198380461320985,0,-0.05227877340566136,0,-0.06970503120754848,0,-0.01742625780188712,0,-0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0.03485251560377424,-0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0.06970503120754848,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,0,-0.05227877340566136,0,-0.08713128900943559,0,0,0.01742625780188712,-0.01742625780188712,0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08713128900943559,0,0,0,0.01742625780188712,-0.06970503120754848,0.03485251560377424,0,0.12198380461320985,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,0.01742625780188712,-0.03485251560377424,0,-0.03485251560377424,0.03485251560377424,0,0,0,0.36595141383962954,-0.05227877340566136,0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,0.01742625780188712,-0.03485251560377424,0,-0.03485251560377424,0,0,0.05227877340566136,0,0.01742625780188712,0,0,0,0,-0.03485251560377424,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-198-1","text":"> We thought that biological systems were... were three-dimensional pattern organisations, and of course what we had to do then was to try to ask how did you create patterns in three dimensions? But... we found that in most of the cases that we could look at, **the pattern was really created in two dimensions, and the third dimension was obtained in another way** either by rolling a sheet into a tube or by actually multiplying the cells, so that biological systems were essentially two-dimensional. > > And of course at one stage we thought, well, two dimensions is quite hard to deal with. Possibly there exist one-dimensional systems. And so the one-dimensional system that I had remembered again from my reading into strange microorganisms, was a blue-green algae. Namely, there were these algae, *Anabaena* was the name, that the cells divided, and at regular places along this filament little differentiated cells appeared, called heterocysts. And the question is how did something know to be a heterocyst and how did it know to be placed in exactly this way. > > There was a group in London that worked on this, a man called Fogg, and I went to see him, and he worked at a thing which I think alas is now defunct, Westfield College, which is in North London, he was a teacher of botany at this place. And so I went to see him to get some cultures of this organism and I grew them. They had to be grown in the light, and indeed, if you broke off the thing, you started with this, and you could actually watch the heterocysts appear. > > And I managed to persuade two young men, one Mike Wilcox, who had come to join us and whose work had been in... strictly in molecular biology, he'd been originally trained as a chemist, and then he'd moved into molecular biology. And he wanted to do something different, and so I persuaded him and a theoretician, a young... young algebraic topologist called Graham Mitchison to take a look at this. > > Now, I think it's important to... to realise that... that one of the things that we did and which ran through all of our work, and which I think came, at least from my background of always having a microscope around and always having a look, in fact **I had invented something called HAL biology. HAL, that's H-A-L, it stood for Have A Look biology**. I mean, what's the use of doing a lot of biochemistry when you can just see what happened? > > This actually stemmed from an experience of mine many years before when I worked on protoplasts. Sol Spiegelman had claimed that when he took ribonuclease and had added these to the protoplasts they stopped making protein. And he thought... he took that as evidence that RNA was involved in protein synthesis. But **I always looked at the protoplasts with a microscope, and when I added ribonuclease they disappeared**, which of course was a very good reason why they stopped making proteins, stopped doing everything. The, the ribonuclease lysed them. Presumably it went in, hydrolysed the RNA and that created some osmotic effect and they blew up. > > So I think that one has to be... and so have a look biology did this. And one of the interesting things they did, which of course we kept... we did a lot of was simply, just to look at these filaments as they grew. So that when you got to a certain state you had the entire history of how that state was reached. So instead of looking at filaments at one stage, we looked then at their history, and you could do statistics on the history as well.","section":198,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.05392618512730701,0,0,-0.013481546281826752,0,-0.013481546281826752,0,0,0.161778555381921,0,0,0,0.013481546281826752,-0.05392618512730701,0,-0.013481546281826752,0,0,0.1348154628182675,0,0.09437082397278726,-0.013481546281826752,0.04044463884548025,-0.10785237025461401,0,0,0,0,0.45837257358210953,-0.026963092563653503,0.013481546281826752,-0.013481546281826752,0.026963092563653503,-0.013481546281826752,0.013481546281826752,-0.026963092563653503,0.269630925636535,0,0.4044463884548026,0,0.026963092563653503,-0.026963092563653503,0,0,0,0,0.026963092563653503,0,0.013481546281826752,0,0,-0.013481546281826752,0,0,0,0,0,-0.026963092563653503,0.013481546281826752,0,0,-0.05392618512730701,0.09437082397278726,0,0.026963092563653503,-0.013481546281826752,0,0,0,-0.013481546281826752,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04044463884548025,-0.026963092563653503,0.05392618512730701,0,0,0,0.013481546281826752,0,0.013481546281826752,0,0,0,0,-0.05392618512730701,0.04044463884548025,0,0.013481546281826752,-0.04044463884548025,0.026963092563653503,-0.04044463884548025,0.0808892776909605,-0.04044463884548025,0,-0.013481546281826752,0.013481546281826752,-0.013481546281826752,0,-0.013481546281826752,0,-0.013481546281826752,0,0,0.013481546281826752,-0.10785237025461401,0,0,0.04044463884548025,-0.013481546281826752,0,0,0.013481546281826752,0,0,-0.026963092563653503,0,-0.026963092563653503,0.013481546281826752,-0.013481546281826752,0,-0.013481546281826752,0.05392618512730701,-0.1348154628182675,0,0,0.013481546281826752,0,0,0,0.013481546281826752,-0.026963092563653503,0.026963092563653503,-0.026963092563653503,0.04044463884548025,0,0.013481546281826752,-0.04044463884548025,0.013481546281826752,-0.013481546281826752,0,-0.026963092563653503,0,-0.013481546281826752,0.0808892776909605,0,0,0,0,0,0.013481546281826752,-0.013481546281826752,0.17526010166374778,0,0.05392618512730701,-0.013481546281826752,0.013481546281826752,-0.0808892776909605,0.026963092563653503,-0.013481546281826752,0,-0.013481546281826752,0,-0.0808892776909605,0.026963092563653503,0,0.29659401820018855,-0.04044463884548025,0,-0.013481546281826752,0,0,0,0,0.026963092563653503,0,0,0,0.013481546281826752,0,0,-0.026963092563653503,0.013481546281826752,0,0.05392618512730701,0,0.09437082397278726,0,0.013481546281826752,-0.06740773140913375,0.013481546281826752,0,0,0,0.05392618512730701,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.013481546281826752,0,-0.013481546281826752,0.013481546281826752,0,0,0,0,-0.05392618512730701,0,-0.026963092563653503,0,-0.04044463884548025,0,0,0,-0.04044463884548025,0.026963092563653503,0,0,0,0,-0.026963092563653503,0,0,0,-0.013481546281826752,0,-0.04044463884548025,0.14829700910009427,0,0,-0.04044463884548025,0.04044463884548025,0,0,0,0.026963092563653503,-0.05392618512730701,0,0,0,-0.09437082397278726,0.026963092563653503,0,0,0,0.04044463884548025,0,0.026963092563653503,-0.013481546281826752,0.06740773140913375,-0.013481546281826752,0.013481546281826752,-0.013481546281826752,0,-0.05392618512730701,0.04044463884548025,0,0.05392618512730701,0,0,0,0,-0.05392618512730701,0,-0.04044463884548025,0,-0.0808892776909605,0,0,0.013481546281826752,0,0.013481546281826752,-0.06740773140913375,0.013481546281826752,-0.013481546281826752,0,0,0.013481546281826752,0,0,0,0,-0.12133391653644077,0.026963092563653503,0,0,0,0.013481546281826752,-0.04044463884548025,0.04044463884548025,0,0.05392618512730701,0,0,0,0.1348154628182675,0,0.04044463884548025,0,0,0,0.013481546281826752,0,0.013481546281826752,-0.013481546281826752,0.013481546281826752,-0.013481546281826752,0,-0.026963092563653503,0.013481546281826752,-0.013481546281826752,0,0,0.013481546281826752,0,0,-0.013481546281826752,0.013481546281826752,-0.013481546281826752,0,0,0.013481546281826752,0,0,0,0.026963092563653503,-0.04044463884548025,0.013481546281826752,0,0.06740773140913375,-0.026963092563653503,0,0,0.013481546281826752,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.013481546281826752,0.09437082397278726,0,0,0,0.269630925636535,-0.04044463884548025,0,-0.04044463884548025,0,0,0.013481546281826752,-0.013481546281826752,0,-0.026963092563653503,0.013481546281826752,-0.013481546281826752,0.013481546281826752,0,0.04044463884548025,-0.026963092563653503,0,-0.013481546281826752,0.013481546281826752,0,0.026963092563653503,0,0.05392618512730701,0]},{"id":"transcript-199-1","text":"> Francis had one day came and put in the office a rather large text which said ***Reading Rots The Mind***. I think he saw it somewhere and had it enlarged, copied and enlarged and pinned it up there. I don't know what it was intended for, but I think it must have been the very similar to many of the people's quoting to us of Rutherford's famous remark that there are two kinds of science, there is stamp collecting, there is some kinds there is real science, and that's physics, and everything else is stamp collecting. To which I once replied, **well it turns out there are some stamps worth collecting**. It's true most of them aren't interesting. > > However, this may have been related to this because **biology was a subject in which you had to read extensively** and in my opinion. That is, there was everything is specific. Animals differ from each other, they differ from plants, their bacteria, the whole diversity of life and the diversity of investigation into this is enormous. And of course I just felt you just had to know a lot, you had to know a lot and especially I think if you were going to do experimental work you had to know a lot about the living world, because **I've always felt that somewhere there is the ideal organism to do the work, and if only we could find it we could cut years out of this**. > > I think Francis himself read a lot. I don't know why he put this up, but he didn't want to he wanted I think to say that science is not a scholarly enterprise, which of course embedded, as we were in an ancient university where there were still people writing books on cells by which were just compendia Francis I think wanted to emphasise that you had to think as well. And that was fine. In other words, **reading was not enough**. I agreed with him. Reading's not enough. But **sometimes thinking isn't enough either**, as well, because in the end **it's doing what counts** and so doing is what was our business. > > I never took it seriously. I mean, I didn't become a secret reader because of this. I just read all the time. If there was anything on a piece of paper I read it. And of course I spent a lot of time reading this, and it's the one thing I do like, is it's something I I always do and I still do it. I like to go to libraries and browse. I spend a lot of time doing this. At the Scripps I spend two hours every day just going to the library and looking at the journals, just seeing what's there, reading a bit of this or, if I pick up something in *Bone and Joint Surgery*, I like to see what are these people doing. So I spend a lot of time browsing, a lot of time and a lot of time reading.","section":199,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0.03441122815090679,-0.017205614075453395,0.017205614075453395,0,0.03441122815090679,-0.051616842226360184,0.017205614075453395,0,0,-0.051616842226360184,0,0,0.03441122815090679,0,0.12043929852817375,0,0.12043929852817375,0,0,-0.03441122815090679,0,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0.37852350965997467,-0.017205614075453395,0,-0.08602807037726698,0,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0.3097010533581611,0,0.3441122815090679,-0.017205614075453395,0.017205614075453395,0,0,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0.10323368445272037,0,0,0,0.03441122815090679,-0.03441122815090679,0,0,0,-0.017205614075453395,0.017205614075453395,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0.017205614075453395,0,0.017205614075453395,-0.06882245630181358,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03441122815090679,-0.03441122815090679,0,0,0,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0,-0.017205614075453395,0,-0.12043929852817375,0,0,0,-0.017205614075453395,0.03441122815090679,0,0.08602807037726698,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0.017205614075453395,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03441122815090679,0.03441122815090679,0,0,0,0.017205614075453395,-0.03441122815090679,0,-0.017205614075453395,0.017205614075453395,0,0,-0.03441122815090679,0,-0.03441122815090679,0,0,0,-0.15485052667908056,0,0,0.017205614075453395,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0.017205614075453395,-0.06882245630181358,0,0,0.051616842226360184,-0.03441122815090679,0,-0.03441122815090679,0.017205614075453395,0,0,-0.03441122815090679,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017205614075453395,0.12043929852817375,0,0.03441122815090679,-0.017205614075453395,0.03441122815090679,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03441122815090679,0.08602807037726698,0,0.18926175482998733,0,0.017205614075453395,-0.017205614075453395,0.017205614075453395,0,0,-0.051616842226360184,0,0,0.06882245630181358,0,0,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0,-0.051616842226360184,0.051616842226360184,0,0.017205614075453395,0,0.017205614075453395,0,0.017205614075453395,0,0,0,0.15485052667908056,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0,-0.051616842226360184,0,-0.03441122815090679,0,-0.03441122815090679,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06882245630181358,0,-0.18926175482998733,0,-0.13764491260362716,0,0,0,0,0.017205614075453395,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0,-0.017205614075453395,0.017205614075453395,-0.017205614075453395,0,-0.017205614075453395,0.03441122815090679,0,0.017205614075453395,-0.03441122815090679,0.12043929852817375,0,0,-0.03441122815090679,0,-0.017205614075453395,0.017205614075453395,-0.017205614075453395,0,-0.10323368445272037,0,0,0.017205614075453395,-0.017205614075453395,0.03441122815090679,0,0,0,0.10323368445272037,-0.017205614075453395,0.06882245630181358,0,0.017205614075453395,0,0.051616842226360184,0,0,-0.03441122815090679,0.051616842226360184,-0.017205614075453395,0.2408785970563475,-0.051616842226360184,0,0,0,-0.18926175482998733,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017205614075453395,0,0,0,0.051616842226360184,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0.017205614075453395,0,0.017205614075453395,0,0.017205614075453395,-0.051616842226360184,0.03441122815090679,0,0,0,0,-0.13764491260362716,0,0,0.03441122815090679,-0.03441122815090679,0,0,0.08602807037726698,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0.017205614075453395,-0.017205614075453395,0,-0.08602807037726698,0.017205614075453395,0,0,-0.03441122815090679,0.017205614075453395,0,0,-0.03441122815090679,0,0,0,0,0.03441122815090679,0,0,0,0.017205614075453395,-0.017205614075453395,0.03441122815090679,-0.017205614075453395,0.06882245630181358,-0.017205614075453395,0.017205614075453395,0,0,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0.017205614075453395,-0.017205614075453395,0,-0.017205614075453395,0.13764491260362716,-0.03441122815090679,0,-0.017205614075453395,0.3097010533581611,-0.017205614075453395,0.017205614075453395,-0.03441122815090679,0,0,0.08602807037726698,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.017205614075453395,0,0,0.03441122815090679,0,0,0,0,-0.017205614075453395]},{"id":"transcript-200-1","text":"> The question is do I make notes or do I remember it all? I make notes. I used to remember more than I did, but that's because I think **my memory stores are full**. I don't think my memory's failing me, I've just reached saturation. > > In fact, I take this very seriously because some years ago when I was a member of an MRC [Medical Research Council] committee, there were certain papers I refused to read and when people asked me had you read the papers, I said no, and when they said why not, I said **I now divide papers into three classes: those that give me information, those that have no effect, and those that remove information from my head**. And the latter is in this class and I'm... I've got very little left and I'm not going to give it over to rubbish like this. > > However, I think that I do remember things, although I can actually remember when my memory first began to fail me, and it was a very interesting thing. Somebody asked me... in fact it was Miranda Robertson asked me: 'who invented interferon?', and I couldn't remember, but the interesting thing is that after a while I said 'It was Abraham'. Now, the interesting thing is that Abraham didn't invent interferon. He invented cephalosporin. The person who invented interferon is Isaacs. Now you will immediately note that **there is a... old connection from enforced study of the Old Testament when I was young, of the connection between Abraham and Isaac**, which just shows you something about how memory is stored. But the immediate connection had been lost there. > > I do make notes, I make extensive notes on everything. I travel around and write down things. I play around in the corner of these things. I used to write things on index cards in the old days. I now tend to write them on exercise... in exercise books, which never get completed. I have a lot of exercise books which have references there and then things, and some of these have never been looked at again. Some have actually developed into whole lines of research. > > **Szilárd was like this. Szilárd always wrote things in exercise books**, but what was remarkable was **he threw them away as soon as he finished them**. And I can remember sitting in Pasteur Institute where Leo was talking to Mel Cohen and Mel Cohen was telling him everything of his new theories of antibody formation, which Leo wrote down.

And so did Francis actually. In fact, we put ours together and I've still got it, and this is reprints that go back to — at least in my case — to the mid 1940s and in Francis's later, and they were arranged alphabetically, so you had to know the author. And they are... I've still got all these boxes, it's about **100 boxes of reprints**.

I noticed that in Judson's history he referred to this paper of Kurt Stern with an early speculation on coding. Now I drew his attention to that because I had a reprint of this paper which I had got because I was an avid reader of the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine, which of course nobody's ever heard of today and I found this article there and I wrote to Kurt Stern from South Africa, and I got a reprint, and I still have that reprint. So this could... so this is a style that I got accustomed to because in South Africa **that's the only way you could get hold of interesting things to read**. > > So reading I think is important, but I think **knowledge is dangerous** and, to... to research. I really think that **a modicum of ignorance is... is absolutely essential**. Because otherwise you don't try anything. And that's why I think in any line of research people can get saturated very quickly because they just know everything. And when a student comes and says, 'Have you, why don't we try this?' you tend to say 'Oh, don't be silly, you know, that'll never work'. > > I had a student who did this, was Anand Sarabhai, a very good student, and he came to me one day and suggested an experiment and I said: 'Look, I don't think it'll work, but please go ahead and try it'. So he went down to the cold room and he got two bottles of phage and he crossed them together and **the experiment worked**. Later we calculated what was the probability that those two bottles were at the front of the queue, because he just took the first ones. The probability was about a million, because I think there were 1000 bottles and the chances of getting two there is one over 1000². So it was a million to one. But **he had what we called the luck of the Sarabhais** and so it worked, so after that everybody asked him to choose the bottles, because that was one way of getting your experiments to work.","section":201,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,0,0.04939986914540882,0,0,0,0.016466623048469606,0,0.016466623048469606,-0.03293324609693921,0,-0.016466623048469606,0.13173298438775685,0,0.016466623048469606,0,0,-0.16466623048469606,0,0,0.016466623048469606,-0.03293324609693921,0.4281321992602098,-0.016466623048469606,0,-0.04939986914540882,0,-0.03293324609693921,0.016466623048469606,0,0.27993259182398333,-0.03293324609693921,0.44459882230867936,-0.04939986914540882,0,-0.03293324609693921,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,0,0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,0,0.016466623048469606,0,0,-0.03293324609693921,0,0,0,0,0.08233311524234803,0,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,-0.03293324609693921,0,0,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,0,0.04939986914540882,0,0,0,0.03293324609693921,0,0.03293324609693921,0,0,0,0.03293324609693921,0,0.03293324609693921,0,0,-0.09879973829081765,0.016466623048469606,0,0.016466623048469606,-0.016466623048469606,0.06586649219387843,0,0.03293324609693921,-0.03293324609693921,0,-0.016466623048469606,0.08233311524234803,-0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,0,0.016466623048469606,0,0,-0.08233311524234803,0,0,0,-0.016466623048469606,0.016466623048469606,-0.016466623048469606,0,-0.016466623048469606,0.016466623048469606,0,0,-0.03293324609693921,0.016466623048469606,-0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,-0.14819960743622645,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,0,0.06586649219387843,0,0.04939986914540882,-0.016466623048469606,0.016466623048469606,-0.016466623048469606,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,-0.016466623048469606,0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,0,0,0.016466623048469606,0,0.11526636133928725,0,0.08233311524234803,0,0,-0.03293324609693921,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,-0.03293324609693921,0,-0.04939986914540882,0.06586649219387843,-0.016466623048469606,0.2469993457270441,-0.09879973829081765,0,0,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,0,0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,0.04939986914540882,-0.04939986914540882,0,0,0,-0.016466623048469606,0.04939986914540882,0,0.03293324609693921,-0.03293324609693921,0.016466623048469606,0,0.06586649219387843,0,0,-0.03293324609693921,0,0,0.016466623048469606,-0.016466623048469606,0.03293324609693921,-0.03293324609693921,0,0,0,-0.04939986914540882,0,0,0,0,0.016466623048469606,-0.03293324609693921,0,0,0,-0.18113285353316566,0.016466623048469606,-0.04939986914540882,0,-0.04939986914540882,0,-0.03293324609693921,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,0,0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,0.13173298438775685,-0.03293324609693921,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,-0.03293324609693921,0,0,0.03293324609693921,-0.016466623048469606,0.03293324609693921,0,0.016466623048469606,-0.11526636133928725,0,0,0,0,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,-0.016466623048469606,0.03293324609693921,0,0,0,0,0,0.14819960743622645,-0.03293324609693921,0.11526636133928725,0,0,0,0,-0.13173298438775685,0,0,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,-0.016466623048469606,0.016466623048469606,-0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06586649219387843,0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,0,-0.08233311524234803,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,0,0.14819960743622645,0,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,0,0.016466623048469606,0,0,-0.03293324609693921,0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,0.03293324609693921,-0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03293324609693921,0,-0.03293324609693921,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,0,0,-0.016466623048469606,0.016466623048469606,0,0.03293324609693921,-0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,0.03293324609693921,0,0,0,0.2963992148724529,-0.016466623048469606,0,-0.016466623048469606,0,-0.03293324609693921,0.016466623048469606,0,0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.09879973829081765,0,0,0.016466623048469606,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-202-1","text":"> In these days, **finding a book that will introduce you to a subject is quite difficult**.

So I think that's important, and nowadays of course one has powerbooks and computers that one can carry around with one, and of course I have this, I have a big database in it, and so I spend quite a lot of time doing research as I travel, and in hotel rooms and at home I have my computer and that's all one needs these days.","section":203,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13391789600139503,0,0.053567158400558014,0,0,-0.10713431680111603,0.08035073760083702,0,0,0,0.053567158400558014,0,0.13391789600139503,0,0,-0.10713431680111603,0.053567158400558014,0,0,0,0.3481865296036271,0,0,0,0,-0.053567158400558014,0.08035073760083702,0,0.21426863360223206,0,0.5088880048053012,0,0,-0.10713431680111603,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.053567158400558014,0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.026783579200279007,0.026783579200279007,0,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.026783579200279007,0,0.053567158400558014,0,0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,-0.026783579200279007,0.13391789600139503,-0.053567158400558014,0,0,0,0,0.053567158400558014,0,0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.13391789600139503,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,-0.026783579200279007,0.10713431680111603,0,0.026783579200279007,0,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,-0.08035073760083702,0,-0.053567158400558014,0,0,0,-0.053567158400558014,0,0,0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,-0.026783579200279007,0.026783579200279007,-0.026783579200279007,0.08035073760083702,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.18748505440195304,0,0,0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18748505440195304,0,0.026783579200279007,-0.026783579200279007,0,-0.08035073760083702,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,0,-0.026783579200279007,0.18748505440195304,0,0,0,0.053567158400558014,0,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,0,0.053567158400558014,0,0.026783579200279007,-0.053567158400558014,0,0,0,0,0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,-0.053567158400558014,0,0,0,-0.026783579200279007,0.08035073760083702,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.053567158400558014,0.026783579200279007,0,0,-0.08035073760083702,0,-0.10713431680111603,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,-0.08035073760083702,0,0,0,-0.18748505440195304,0,0,0,0,0,-0.053567158400558014,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,0,0.08035073760083702,0,0,0,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,0,0.026783579200279007,0,0.026783579200279007,0,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,0,0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0.053567158400558014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.053567158400558014,0,0,0,0,-0.08035073760083702,0.026783579200279007,0,0,-0.10713431680111603,0,0,0,0,0.026783579200279007,0,0.026783579200279007,-0.026783579200279007,0,0,0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08035073760083702,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.053567158400558014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.026783579200279007,0,0,-0.026783579200279007,0.13391789600139503,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.026783579200279007,0,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,0,0.053567158400558014,0,0,0,0,-0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,0.026783579200279007,-0.026783579200279007,0.13391789600139503,-0.026783579200279007,0,0,0.16070147520167405,-0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.24105221280251107,-0.026783579200279007,0,0,0,0,0.026783579200279007,-0.053567158400558014,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-204-1","text":"> It's very clear, we were discussing both development and the nervous system as a... as an issue at the time. The nervous system... I had a long interest in, because of... I actually reconstructed a brain of galago when I was a science student in South Africa. We had a good centre of neuroanatomy. I was an extremely good neuroanatomist at the time, because my teachers were neuroanatomists. And so... and with my relationship with Seymour Papert, where I taught him neurophysiology, and I taught neurophysiology in the physiology class, so I was not a novice at this. But **I had no idea at that time how you would connect this up with genes**. > > However, why I finally chose an animal was because **animals have nervous systems**... and not choose a plant. Although I have to say just in passing, I was also very interested in *Arabidopsis* and had become a foundation member of the *Arabidopsis Newsletter*, had in fact got some of these plants, grown them, but it seemed to me plants, as I used to say then, were not real animals. > > And the nervous system is attractive, it's attractive as part of an animal because it embodies so many things that you feel are not going to have a simple explanation. That is... one felt you can't do this with... you could not explain nervous systems with simple things that you used to explain beta-galactosidase induction. At least that's how it seemed there. > > Now, Seymour Benzer was also interested in the nervous system, but he had decided to go from the gene to behaviour. And I know for certain that at a very early stage I did not see that as a feasible issue, just largely on theoretical grounds, but also because I had become very clear that **the units of development were cells, the units of the nervous system were cells**. > > And I know this because I recall very clearly a student coming up to me and said: 'Doctor Brenner, what is going to be the next breakthrough in the nervous system?' And I said to him, '**you are 50 years too late, it's already happened, it's called the neuron hypothesis**'. Because of course prior to that people thought that nervous systems were continua and the triumph of actually showing that they were built of nerve cells connected to each other, that was the breakthrough.","section":204,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11851598962634854,0,0,0,0.01975266493772476,-0.0987633246886238,0,0,0.01975266493772476,0,0.15802131950179807,0,0.03950532987544952,0,0,-0.05925799481317427,0,-0.01975266493772476,0.01975266493772476,0,0.49381662344311894,0,0.01975266493772476,-0.01975266493772476,0,-0.11851598962634854,0.01975266493772476,0,0.2370319792526971,0,0.2370319792526971,-0.01975266493772476,0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01975266493772476,0,0.05925799481317427,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,-0.0987633246886238,0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0,-0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03950532987544952,0,0,0,0.03950532987544952,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03950532987544952,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0.01975266493772476,0,0.07901065975089903,0,0.01975266493772476,-0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03950532987544952,0,0,0.01975266493772476,-0.01975266493772476,0,-0.01975266493772476,0,-0.01975266493772476,0.01975266493772476,-0.01975266493772476,0,-0.05925799481317427,0,0,0,-0.05925799481317427,0,-0.07901065975089903,0,-0.01975266493772476,0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,0.05925799481317427,0,0,0,0.07901065975089903,0,0,0,0.01975266493772476,-0.01975266493772476,0.03950532987544952,-0.03950532987544952,0,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0.01975266493772476,0,0.01975266493772476,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0.15802131950179807,0,0.05925799481317427,-0.03950532987544952,0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,0,-0.05925799481317427,0,0,0.03950532987544952,0,0.3753006338167704,-0.03950532987544952,0,0,0.0987633246886238,0,0.01975266493772476,0,0.03950532987544952,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1975266493772476,0.01975266493772476,0,0.07901065975089903,0,0,0,0,0,0.01975266493772476,-0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0.01975266493772476,-0.03950532987544952,0,0,0.01975266493772476,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,0,0.01975266493772476,0,0,-0.1975266493772476,0.03950532987544952,-0.03950532987544952,0,-0.03950532987544952,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,0,0.03950532987544952,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0.1382686545640733,-0.01975266493772476,0,-0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,0,0.01975266493772476,0,0.01975266493772476,0,0,-0.03950532987544952,0,-0.03950532987544952,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01975266493772476,0,0.11851598962634854,0,0,-0.07901065975089903,0,0,0.1382686545640733,0,0.03950532987544952,-0.01975266493772476,0.01975266493772476,-0.05925799481317427,0.03950532987544952,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0,0,0.1975266493772476,0,0,0,0.03950532987544952,0,0.03950532987544952,0,0,0,0,0,0.01975266493772476,-0.03950532987544952,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0.01975266493772476,0,0.05925799481317427,-0.03950532987544952,0,0,0.03950532987544952,-0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0.01975266493772476,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01975266493772476,0,-0.01975266493772476,0,-0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,0,0.05925799481317427,-0.01975266493772476,0,-0.03950532987544952,0,0,0.07901065975089903,0,0,0,0.01975266493772476,-0.01975266493772476,0,0,0.03950532987544952,0,0.01975266493772476,-0.01975266493772476,0.05925799481317427,0,0,0,0.25678464419042185,-0.0987633246886238,0.03950532987544952,0,0,0,0.01975266493772476,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01975266493772476,-0.03950532987544952,0,0,0.01975266493772476,0,0.01975266493772476,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-205-1","text":"> It is fair to say that **I was not interested in development *per se***.

We have to say not somehow, but how.** And I think that ultimately, although we may not have to do it in detail, ultimately that has to be the nature of explanation.","section":207,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.09657341699694758,0,0,0,0,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0,-0.03219113899898252,0,-0.09657341699694758,0,0,0.3219113899898252,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2897202509908427,0,0.2575291119918602,0,0.06438227799796505,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0.09657341699694758,0,0,0,0,-0.06438227799796505,0.09657341699694758,0,0.03219113899898252,-0.03219113899898252,0,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0,-0.09657341699694758,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03219113899898252,0,0,0,0,0.06438227799796505,0,0,-0.09657341699694758,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03219113899898252,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03219113899898252,0,-0.03219113899898252,0,0,0,-0.1287645559959301,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06438227799796505,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09657341699694758,0,0,-0.09657341699694758,0,0,0,-0.06438227799796505,0,0,0.1287645559959301,0,0,0,0.06438227799796505,0,0,0,0.19314683399389515,0,0,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0,-0.09657341699694758,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.48286708498473785,-0.03219113899898252,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09657341699694758,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06438227799796505,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06438227799796505,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03219113899898252,0,-0.03219113899898252,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06438227799796505,0.03219113899898252,0,0,-0.03219113899898252,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0,-0.06438227799796505,0,-0.06438227799796505,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06438227799796505,0,0,0,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.09657341699694758,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0.09657341699694758,0,0,-0.03219113899898252,0,0,0.09657341699694758,0,0,-0.03219113899898252,0.06438227799796505,-0.2575291119918602,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03219113899898252,0.1287645559959301,0,0,-0.03219113899898252,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06438227799796505,0,0,0.03219113899898252,-0.09657341699694758,0,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0,-0.09657341699694758,0,-0.1609556949949126,0.09657341699694758,-0.06438227799796505,0,0,0.09657341699694758,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06438227799796505,0,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06438227799796505,0,0,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0,-0.03219113899898252,0,0,0.03219113899898252,-0.06438227799796505,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0.06438227799796505,-0.06438227799796505,0,-0.06438227799796505,0,0,0.22533797299287767,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03219113899898252,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-208-1","text":"> I think organisms have to be computed from their DNA sequences, just as we have to compute proteins from its DNA... a protein from its DNA sequence. Now, when I say compute, I... I mean it in the sense of... of a computation, this need not be a calculation but in fact... and we may not even use a... a digital computer, almost certainly we will, because it's a universal computer, when programmed with the right program we could do this. > > Now, we have to do it in this way for the simple reason that **this is the only way you can get to the final... the so-called final explanation**. Otherwise we simply have a set of anecdotes, and this is particularly true if we want to go to yet a more complex thing, which is how to account for behaviour, for the operations of the nervous system. If we say what does an animal or a person do in such and such circumstances, we simply make observations of those circumstances, we then try to look at relationships between these and then of course we try to get a predictive theory of behaviour, and in many cases it falls... it... it fails when it becomes a little bit richer because this simple connection is usually too simple... too simple a correlation. > > Now, rather than providing an anecdote, roughly speaking, to take each case and have a look; that is if you ask what does this animal do if you give it a cigarette to smoke? Well, you have to give it a cigarette to smoke and see what happens, then you can give an answer to that question. But **there is no end to asking such questions**, so we have what I call **a halting problem in the Turing sense**. There is no end to the number of questions and answers that we may pose about any complex system. > > Now, the only way then we could answer those questions without recourse to the system itself — which of course scientists would say is description — is of course to have a computable theory of it, so that if you can ask me that question I will get the theory to produce the answer. We could then go and check that it's correct. > > Now, if you have a unique theory that can do this, and I actually don't think that for behaviour this will be attainable in a very general sense, because — that is, from the genes — because I think what we can have is a unique theory about how the nervous system is constructed from the genes, then we have to start from... with nervous systems and then develop theories of how they work. That is why with the *C. elegans* [*Caenorhabditis elegans*] project it became important to specify the wiring diagram and to ask the question **is behaviour computable from the wiring diagram alone** — plus some initial conditions, I should add — because that's a style of answer which is very similar to answering questions about how you build machines, is it computable? > > And this I think raises the question of what is considered a proper computation in this sense, and that I think that can be answered very quickly. That is, **it should be in the machine language of the thing being simulated**. That is, if you wish to describe nematode behaviour it should not be in terms of sin(θ), cos(θ), which may well be very good to generate the wavy... the serpentine motion that they have, but must be in terms of neurones and their connections. That is **the machine language of that**. > > Just like **the machine language of development is in terms of cells and the recognition proteins they carry on them**, and all the mechanisms they have to process signals. That's the machine language of development. Machine language of development is not gradients and it's not differential equations. So that is... so I just ruled them out instantly as just boring descriptions of what there is in an incomprehensible language, just like sin(θ), cos(θ) is another boring description in an incomprehensible language. So **the machine language of the object is important** and it is, if you like, the task of experimental biologists to define that.","section":208,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.08771107318724708,0,0.04385553659362354,0,0.010963884148405885,0,0.032891652445217655,-0.010963884148405885,0.010963884148405885,0,0,0,0.010963884148405885,-0.02192776829681177,0.010963884148405885,0,0.010963884148405885,0,0.032891652445217655,0,0.12060272563246474,0,0,-0.06578330489043531,0.02192776829681177,-0.06578330489043531,0.02192776829681177,0,0.48241090252985896,0,0.010963884148405885,0,0,-0.04385553659362354,0,-0.010963884148405885,0.2960248720069589,0,0.2192776829681177,-0.010963884148405885,0.010963884148405885,0,0,0,0.032891652445217655,0,0,-0.02192776829681177,0.010963884148405885,-0.010963884148405885,0.032891652445217655,0,0,0,0.010963884148405885,-0.02192776829681177,0,-0.010963884148405885,0.010963884148405885,0,0,-0.010963884148405885,0.032891652445217655,-0.010963884148405885,0.02192776829681177,-0.010963884148405885,0,0,0,-0.04385553659362354,0,0,0,0,0,-0.010963884148405885,0,0,0.010963884148405885,-0.010963884148405885,0.010963884148405885,-0.02192776829681177,0,0,0,0,0.010963884148405885,0,0.010963884148405885,-0.010963884148405885,0,-0.054819420742029425,0.010963884148405885,-0.02192776829681177,0,-0.010963884148405885,0.032891652445217655,0,0.054819420742029425,-0.04385553659362354,0,0,0.054819420742029425,-0.02192776829681177,0.010963884148405885,-0.02192776829681177,0.010963884148405885,0,0,-0.032891652445217655,0,-0.010963884148405885,0,0,0,0,0,-0.010963884148405885,0,0,0,0,0,-0.23024156711652358,0.010963884148405885,0,0,-0.04385553659362354,0.02192776829681177,-0.12060272563246474,0,0,0.010963884148405885,0,0,0,0,-0.02192776829681177,0,0,0.032891652445217655,-0.032891652445217655,0.02192776829681177,-0.032891652445217655,0.04385553659362354,-0.02192776829681177,0.010963884148405885,0,0,0,0.02192776829681177,0,0.010963884148405885,0,0,0,0.032891652445217655,0,0.16445826222608828,0,0,0,0.010963884148405885,0,0,-0.02192776829681177,0,-0.02192776829681177,0,-0.010963884148405885,0.02192776829681177,-0.010963884148405885,0.24120545126492948,0,0,-0.010963884148405885,0.02192776829681177,0,0,-0.02192776829681177,0.02192776829681177,0,0.04385553659362354,-0.02192776829681177,0,0,0.02192776829681177,0,0,-0.032891652445217655,0.032891652445217655,-0.010963884148405885,0.032891652445217655,0,0,0,0,0,0.010963884148405885,-0.010963884148405885,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02192776829681177,0,0,0,0,0.010963884148405885,0,0,0,0,-0.04385553659362354,0.010963884148405885,-0.010963884148405885,0,-0.054819420742029425,0,-0.032891652445217655,0.032891652445217655,-0.10963884148405885,0,0,0,-0.010963884148405885,0,-0.06578330489043531,0.010963884148405885,0,0.010963884148405885,0,0,-0.010963884148405885,0.010963884148405885,0,0.06578330489043531,-0.010963884148405885,0.010963884148405885,-0.02192776829681177,0,0,0.02192776829681177,-0.0767471890388412,0,0,0,0,0,-0.032891652445217655,0,0,0,-0.04385553659362354,0,-0.010963884148405885,0,-0.02192776829681177,0,0,0.13156660978087062,-0.032891652445217655,0.0767471890388412,-0.02192776829681177,0.054819420742029425,0,0,-0.04385553659362354,0.02192776829681177,0,0.18638603052290004,0,0.010963884148405885,0,0,-0.3179526403037707,0,0,0,-0.054819420742029425,0,0,0.0767471890388412,-0.010963884148405885,0,0,0.010963884148405885,-0.010963884148405885,0,0,0,0,0.032891652445217655,0,0.010963884148405885,-0.18638603052290004,0.054819420742029425,0,0,0,0.010963884148405885,-0.0767471890388412,0.032891652445217655,-0.010963884148405885,0.010963884148405885,0,0,0,0.010963884148405885,-0.010963884148405885,0,-0.010963884148405885,0.010963884148405885,0,0,0,0.010963884148405885,-0.010963884148405885,0,0,0,-0.02192776829681177,0.02192776829681177,0,0,-0.010963884148405885,0,0,0,-0.02192776829681177,0,-0.02192776829681177,0,0,0.032891652445217655,-0.010963884148405885,0.010963884148405885,0,0.010963884148405885,0,0.02192776829681177,0,0.054819420742029425,-0.02192776829681177,0,0,0.010963884148405885,0,0,-0.010963884148405885,0.032891652445217655,0,0.02192776829681177,0,0.04385553659362354,-0.02192776829681177,0,0,0.3179526403037707,-0.04385553659362354,0.04385553659362354,0,0,0,0.010963884148405885,-0.010963884148405885,0,0,0,0,0.010963884148405885,-0.010963884148405885,0.0767471890388412,-0.0767471890388412,0,0,0.054819420742029425,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-209-1","text":"> Many people working in experimental biology simply think that when they've got it all... they've got the long list of components and have it all together, that there will be a blinding insight that will be achieved.

Then you can go and buy computer programs or you can get access to these models, and some of them are printed, pictures of them are printed, you can look at them in 3-D, and you can have the feeling that is... so what we need, I think, is **confidence in the kind of conceptual structure** that may exist in other people and maybe that's the clue, that there's a kind of **communal, if you like, mental fashion that emerges** to say, yes we understand this protein structure. > > Although no one there could reproduce, you know, the structure of haemoglobin, for example, and in fact no one would want to unless they were working on it. So I think that this will... this will emerge in the same way. The integrative work will be done in great detail — has to be done in great detail — on very circumscribed problems. And then once those are solved, then this will be the style with which you solve such problems and this will now become to be accepted as the solution and **people will just wonder why they ever asked such questions 50 years ago**.","section":209,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.15274831528058397,0,0.027772420960106178,0,0,0,0.027772420960106178,0,0.027772420960106178,-0.027772420960106178,0.041658631440159265,-0.027772420960106178,0,-0.027772420960106178,0,-0.055544841920212355,0.041658631440159265,0,0.041658631440159265,0,0.06943105240026544,-0.027772420960106178,0,-0.08331726288031853,0.027772420960106178,0,0,0,0.5554484192021235,0,0,0,0,-0.027772420960106178,0.013886210480053089,0,0.18052073624069015,-0.06943105240026544,0.2499517886409556,0,0,-0.041658631440159265,0.055544841920212355,-0.013886210480053089,0.013886210480053089,0,0,0,0.013886210480053089,0,0,0,0.013886210480053089,0,0,0,0,-0.06943105240026544,0,-0.013886210480053089,0.027772420960106178,-0.027772420960106178,0,-0.041658631440159265,0,0,0,-0.041658631440159265,0.013886210480053089,-0.027772420960106178,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.013886210480053089,0.027772420960106178,-0.013886210480053089,0,0,0.013886210480053089,0,0.013886210480053089,0,0,0,0.013886210480053089,-0.06943105240026544,0,-0.027772420960106178,0,0,0.013886210480053089,-0.013886210480053089,0.041658631440159265,-0.06943105240026544,0,0,0.013886210480053089,0,0,0,0.027772420960106178,-0.013886210480053089,0,-0.013886210480053089,0.027772420960106178,-0.09720347336037162,0.027772420960106178,0,0,0,0,-0.013886210480053089,0,-0.013886210480053089,0.013886210480053089,0,0.013886210480053089,-0.041658631440159265,0,-0.013886210480053089,0,-0.013886210480053089,0.09720347336037162,-0.1249758943204778,0,0,0.027772420960106178,0,0,0,0.055544841920212355,0,0.013886210480053089,0,0.041658631440159265,-0.19440694672074324,0,-0.027772420960106178,0.013886210480053089,-0.013886210480053089,0,0,0,0,0.013886210480053089,0,0.013886210480053089,0,0,-0.013886210480053089,0.027772420960106178,0,0.13886210480053088,-0.013886210480053089,0.013886210480053089,0,0.013886210480053089,-0.027772420960106178,0,0,0,-0.013886210480053089,0,0,0.041658631440159265,-0.09720347336037162,0.30549663056116794,-0.027772420960106178,0,-0.027772420960106178,0.013886210480053089,0,0,0,0,0,0.013886210480053089,0,0,0,0,-0.013886210480053089,0,-0.027772420960106178,0.06943105240026544,0,0,0,0,0,0.041658631440159265,0,0,0,0.013886210480053089,-0.013886210480053089,0,0,0,-0.055544841920212355,0.013886210480053089,0,0,-0.013886210480053089,0,-0.013886210480053089,0,0,0,-0.041658631440159265,0,0,0,-0.041658631440159265,0.013886210480053089,-0.08331726288031853,0.027772420960106178,-0.027772420960106178,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06943105240026544,0,0,0.027772420960106178,0,0,0,0.013886210480053089,0,0.041658631440159265,0,0,-0.013886210480053089,0.041658631440159265,0,0,0,0.027772420960106178,0,0,0,0.013886210480053089,-0.013886210480053089,0,-0.041658631440159265,0.013886210480053089,-0.08331726288031853,0.013886210480053089,0,0,0,0,0,0.041658631440159265,0,0.09720347336037162,-0.013886210480053089,0,0,0,-0.027772420960106178,0.041658631440159265,0,0.19440694672074324,0,0.013886210480053089,-0.013886210480053089,0.041658631440159265,-0.11108968384042471,0,0,0,-0.027772420960106178,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.013886210480053089,-0.013886210480053089,0,0,0.013886210480053089,0,0,0,0.013886210480053089,-0.11108968384042471,0,0,0,0,0,-0.055544841920212355,0.013886210480053089,-0.027772420960106178,0,0,0,0,0.1249758943204778,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.027772420960106178,0.013886210480053089,0,0,-0.027772420960106178,0.055544841920212355,0,0.1249758943204778,-0.027772420960106178,0,-0.013886210480053089,0,-0.013886210480053089,0,0,0,0,0.013886210480053089,0,0.013886210480053089,0,0,0,0.027772420960106178,0,0.027772420960106178,0,0.013886210480053089,0,0.055544841920212355,-0.013886210480053089,0,0,0.08331726288031853,0,0.041658631440159265,-0.055544841920212355,0.013886210480053089,-0.041658631440159265,0,0,0.2916104200811149,-0.041658631440159265,0,-0.027772420960106178,0,0,0.08331726288031853,0,0,-0.041658631440159265,0,0,0,0,0.055544841920212355,-0.11108968384042471,0,-0.013886210480053089,0.027772420960106178,0,0,0,0,-0.013886210480053089]},{"id":"transcript-210-1","text":"> The question is whether in the '60s we were right in thinking that all the problems of molecular biology had been... had been solved in outline. They were solved in outline because that is essentially what we... we saw the solution on, and we thought then the rest is... the rest is just, you know, routine work. Now, one of the remarkable things about science is that **routine work itself generates its important problems which you don't see**, and of course as you stand on the brink or on the edge... or on the transition point as science goes from the heroic... its **heroic period into its classical period** as Gunther Stent used to say, which of course by about 1961 that is exactly where molecular biology stood; there were no longer great heroes that would do all of this work, that were evangelists in some way that was bringing, that were bringing new message to... to everybody, because now the church was admitting everybody and everybody was becoming converted. > > So it's not... it's not useful to be, if you like... I mean, **being an early Christian must have been exciting, but to be one later is boring, because everybody's converted**. The only thing of being an old Jesuit in the church is you know what's wrong with the church basically, which the new converts don't. It's important to keep quiet about this in the early stages of building up the church. So I think the... and I think we were quite right, if arrogant, to say that for us that wasn't the sort of thing we wanted to do. > > Now of course in biology, **problems have a remarkable way of not being solved, of never being solved**. Take DNA replication. It has been thought to have been solved, I think, at least 10 times in the past, it's thought to be solved today. But I guarantee you people will be working on DNA replication for the next 20 years, for the simple reason that at each level is solved you, first want to know whether... what are the components that do it, then you see that it's not enough just to stick bases in and propagate the chain, you've got to have an editing step so there's going to be some more stuff that comes into that. And so I think these things accrete problems. It may well be that that will be the interest of an extremely small group that will continue with this and will become refined specialists and this just may be a niche of molecular biology which will have been exploited by one particular set of molecular biologists. > > I think it's important that that should go on, but people feel it can't... it's no longer a mystery. And because it's no longer a mystery people feel it can be solved by normal science. And **it's very important, I think, to grasp what can or can't be solved by normal science**, you can just go back to it there.","section":210,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.1451258060400355,0,0,0,0,0,0.029025161208007102,0,0.029025161208007102,-0.014512580604003551,0.014512580604003551,0,0.014512580604003551,-0.04353774181201065,0,-0.014512580604003551,0,0,0.029025161208007102,0,0.10158806422802485,0,0,-0.0870754836240213,0,0,0.014512580604003551,0,0.6095283853681491,-0.014512580604003551,0,0,0,-0.014512580604003551,0.014512580604003551,0,0.24671387026806035,0,0.1451258060400355,0,0.014512580604003551,-0.029025161208007102,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014512580604003551,0,-0.014512580604003551,0.029025161208007102,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13061322543603196,-0.058050322416014204,0.04353774181201065,0,0,-0.014512580604003551,0,0,0.014512580604003551,-0.014512580604003551,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0870754836240213,-0.014512580604003551,0.04353774181201065,0,0,0,0.014512580604003551,0,0.014512580604003551,0,0,-0.10158806422802485,0,-0.014512580604003551,0,0,0.058050322416014204,-0.058050322416014204,0.058050322416014204,-0.014512580604003551,0.014512580604003551,0,0.058050322416014204,0,0.014512580604003551,0,0.014512580604003551,0,0,0,0.014512580604003551,-0.04353774181201065,0,0,0.04353774181201065,-0.014512580604003551,0,-0.014512580604003551,0,0,0,0,0.014512580604003551,-0.07256290302001775,0,0,0,-0.014512580604003551,0,-0.058050322416014204,0,0,0.07256290302001775,-0.014512580604003551,0,0,0.029025161208007102,-0.029025161208007102,0,0,0.04353774181201065,-0.07256290302001775,0,-0.04353774181201065,0.04353774181201065,-0.04353774181201065,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014512580604003551,0,0,0,0,0,0.1451258060400355,0,0.058050322416014204,0,0,-0.029025161208007102,0,-0.058050322416014204,0,0,0,0,0.04353774181201065,0,0.37732709570409234,-0.014512580604003551,0.029025161208007102,-0.029025161208007102,0.014512580604003551,0,0,-0.014512580604003551,0.04353774181201065,-0.014512580604003551,0.014512580604003551,0,0,0,0,0,0.014512580604003551,-0.058050322416014204,0.014512580604003551,-0.014512580604003551,0.029025161208007102,0,0,0,0.04353774181201065,0,0,0,0.014512580604003551,0,0,0,0,-0.04353774181201065,0,0,0.04353774181201065,0,0,0,0,0,0.029025161208007102,0,0.014512580604003551,0,0,-0.058050322416014204,0,-0.04353774181201065,0,-0.058050322416014204,0,0,0,0,0.014512580604003551,-0.07256290302001775,0,0,0.014512580604003551,-0.029025161208007102,0.014512580604003551,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.029025161208007102,0.04353774181201065,0,0,-0.029025161208007102,0.014512580604003551,0,0,-0.029025161208007102,0,0,0,-0.058050322416014204,0.014512580604003551,-0.029025161208007102,0,0,0,-0.014512580604003551,0,0,0.029025161208007102,0,0.07256290302001775,-0.029025161208007102,0.058050322416014204,0,0.029025161208007102,-0.014512580604003551,0.029025161208007102,0,0.21768870906005328,-0.029025161208007102,0,0,0.029025161208007102,-0.13061322543603196,0,-0.014512580604003551,0,-0.014512580604003551,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014512580604003551,-0.014512580604003551,0,-0.014512580604003551,0.014512580604003551,0,0,0,0.014512580604003551,-0.0870754836240213,0.014512580604003551,0,0,0,0,-0.07256290302001775,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04353774181201065,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04353774181201065,0,-0.014512580604003551,0,0,0,-0.11610064483202841,0.04353774181201065,0,0,-0.014512580604003551,0,0,0,-0.029025161208007102,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014512580604003551,0,-0.014512580604003551,0.014512580604003551,0,0.014512580604003551,0,0.058050322416014204,-0.058050322416014204,0,0,0,-0.014512580604003551,0,0,0.029025161208007102,0,0.11610064483202841,-0.014512580604003551,0.029025161208007102,-0.029025161208007102,0,0,0.2031761284560497,-0.058050322416014204,0.014512580604003551,0,0,0,0.07256290302001775,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.029025161208007102,-0.058050322416014204,0,0,0.04353774181201065,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-211-1","text":"> I'm not... the question is about competition. Well, the... well, there's one thing that I think is very important to say, is **if you're always doing new things there's always very little competition**. And it could be argued that in my career I've got out when the competition got hot, if you like. Or maybe I got out when the science got cool, that's another way of putting it. > > No, I don't think you can be affected by competition, although I think a lot of people are. And I think I've always had a consciousness of saying that if our lab starts to be driven, as many labs are, by the forces of competition, then we're in for a bad time for the simple reason that a whole lot of very different things will operate in what I think is... is... and ruin what I think is... is our work and which... which has this great meaning for us. > > And so I've always liked to feel — and even up to now in the work I'm doing now — I've always liked to feel, well **my people should feel that they're out there alone** and they can actually give the problem their big attention and not sit and worry that there are 2500 people sitting in Paducah Tech and are going to, you know, scoop them. And I have to say that **that's the great morale builder in a lab**, and that's what I think you want your young people to feel, because the rest of their lives is going to be spent in... in dealing with that, and in... in dealing with these social forces. > > So competition isn't... isn't a meaning... isn't meaning, and I know that when other people start to work with this it's okay, because I think we encourage them because all they do is help to build up our reputation. That's what I think is... you know that I'm a great follower of... and a great admirer of **Talleyrand**. Talleyrand was a remarkable person, a survivor of everything. He was of course Napoleon's foreign minister, but he persisted right throughout the most incredible changes of regime in France and survived everything to come out at the other end. > > But he had one remark which I have always thought is important, and it is, '**never do for yourself that which you can get other people to do for you**'.

It's first... it's a product of the work structure, because we now have a managerial structure in many labs where there are generals and captains and corporals, there's a whole hierarchy of people that work, and in general the person, the head of a lab, has no direct connection with a bench.

But sometimes it happens that this strikes home at the... in... in the man's mind that this is a novel and very extreme finding.

So I think a lot of that goes on, and I think that once... if you're doing experiments yourself, and you learn what all the snags are and you know that if you're working as part of a group so that you do part of the experiment yourself, then I think that it's very hard to... to get this kind of co-operative crime. > > I think the other things that are now being driven, I... I mean, are the material aspects of science, which is just actually getting enough money for the lab, I think quite a lot of activities there can lead to, if not fraud, certainly exaggeration, if we can put it this way. I think there's a lot of concealment. I think a lot of work is kept secret. That is, there's no free exchange in the sense that people don't tell you what they're doing if they think in fact you'll... you'll get there first. So the competition I think does... does make for kind of... a kind of... now that it's competition not at the individual level in this, but it's at the corporate level, makes then for a kind of struggle that is... that I think has its bad effects.","section":212,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.028129979502043028,0,0,0,0.014064989751021514,-0.028129979502043028,0.04219496925306454,-0.014064989751021514,0.056259959004086056,-0.014064989751021514,0,0,0.014064989751021514,-0.014064989751021514,0.014064989751021514,-0.014064989751021514,0,0,0,0,0.056259959004086056,-0.028129979502043028,0,-0.056259959004086056,0.028129979502043028,-0.014064989751021514,0,-0.028129979502043028,0.5625995900408606,0,0,-0.014064989751021514,0,-0.028129979502043028,0.07032494875510757,0,0.08438993850612908,-0.08438993850612908,0.4219496925306454,0,0.014064989751021514,-0.028129979502043028,0.014064989751021514,0,0.028129979502043028,0,0,-0.028129979502043028,0,0,0.014064989751021514,0,0,0,0.014064989751021514,0,0,0,0.014064989751021514,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07032494875510757,0,-0.056259959004086056,0.04219496925306454,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014064989751021514,-0.014064989751021514,0.04219496925306454,0,0.07032494875510757,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.2109748462653227,0.014064989751021514,0,0,0,0.04219496925306454,-0.028129979502043028,0.014064989751021514,0,0,-0.014064989751021514,0.028129979502043028,0,0.014064989751021514,0,0,0,0.028129979502043028,-0.014064989751021514,0,-0.056259959004086056,0,0,0.014064989751021514,-0.014064989751021514,0.04219496925306454,-0.014064989751021514,0,0,0.028129979502043028,-0.014064989751021514,0.014064989751021514,-0.028129979502043028,0,-0.028129979502043028,0,0,0.028129979502043028,-0.16877987701225816,0,-0.014064989751021514,0.014064989751021514,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.056259959004086056,-0.056259959004086056,0,0,0.04219496925306454,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.014064989751021514,0,0,0,0,0.028129979502043028,0,0.12658490775919362,0,0.028129979502043028,-0.056259959004086056,0.028129979502043028,-0.014064989751021514,0,0,0,0,0,-0.028129979502043028,0.056259959004086056,-0.014064989751021514,0.2672348052694088,-0.014064989751021514,0,0,0.014064989751021514,0,0,0,0.04219496925306454,0,0.014064989751021514,0,0,0,0,0,0.014064989751021514,-0.014064989751021514,0,-0.014064989751021514,0.028129979502043028,0,0,0,0.028129979502043028,-0.014064989751021514,0.014064989751021514,-0.014064989751021514,0.0984549282571506,-0.014064989751021514,0.014064989751021514,0,0,-0.056259959004086056,0,-0.028129979502043028,0,0,0,0,0.028129979502043028,0,0,-0.07032494875510757,0.014064989751021514,-0.04219496925306454,0,-0.056259959004086056,0,-0.11251991800817211,0.056259959004086056,-0.056259959004086056,0,-0.014064989751021514,0,0,0.014064989751021514,-0.028129979502043028,0,0,0.028129979502043028,-0.014064989751021514,0,-0.014064989751021514,0,-0.014064989751021514,0.056259959004086056,-0.014064989751021514,0,0,0,0,0,-0.028129979502043028,0,0,0,0,0.014064989751021514,0,0,0,0,-0.04219496925306454,0,0,0,0,0.04219496925306454,0,0.08438993850612908,-0.014064989751021514,0.014064989751021514,0,0.056259959004086056,0,0,0,0.014064989751021514,0,0.1969098565143012,-0.014064989751021514,0,0,0.028129979502043028,-0.12658490775919362,0,-0.014064989751021514,0,0,0,0,0.014064989751021514,0,0,0,0.014064989751021514,0,0.014064989751021514,0,0.014064989751021514,0,0.014064989751021514,0,0,-0.04219496925306454,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07032494875510757,0.04219496925306454,0,0,0,0,0,0.056259959004086056,-0.028129979502043028,0.028129979502043028,-0.014064989751021514,0,0,0.014064989751021514,0,0,-0.028129979502043028,0,0,0,-0.014064989751021514,0.04219496925306454,0,0.028129979502043028,0,0,0,0,-0.028129979502043028,0,0,0,-0.014064989751021514,0.056259959004086056,0,0.014064989751021514,0,0.028129979502043028,-0.014064989751021514,0,0,0.04219496925306454,-0.028129979502043028,0,0,0,-0.04219496925306454,0,0,0.04219496925306454,-0.014064989751021514,0.014064989751021514,-0.04219496925306454,0.028129979502043028,-0.056259959004086056,0,0,0.2672348052694088,-0.028129979502043028,0,0,0,0,0.028129979502043028,0,0,0,0,0,0.014064989751021514,0,0.07032494875510757,-0.08438993850612908,0.014064989751021514,0,0.08438993850612908,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-213-1","text":"> It also turns out that I think now there are other views about science which I think are wrong.

The other possibility to explain these experiments is that the measurements were wrong. Which they almost certainly were, because this is ludicrous.

And I actually managed to get this published in *Science*, without referees.","section":214,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.036992662308349696,0,0,0,0,-0.036992662308349696,0,-0.036992662308349696,0,0,0.16646698038757363,0,0.09248165577087424,0,0,-0.07398532461669939,0,0,0.018496331154174848,-0.018496331154174848,0.5733862657794203,0,0,0,0,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0.18496331154174847,0,0.2774449673126227,0,0,0,0,0,0.018496331154174848,-0.018496331154174848,0.018496331154174848,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018496331154174848,0,-0.018496331154174848,0.036992662308349696,0,0,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018496331154174848,0.036992662308349696,0,0,0,0.018496331154174848,0,0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.036992662308349696,0,-0.036992662308349696,0,-0.018496331154174848,0.05548899346252455,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0.018496331154174848,-0.036992662308349696,0,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0,0.018496331154174848,-0.05548899346252455,0.036992662308349696,0,0.05548899346252455,-0.036992662308349696,0.018496331154174848,-0.05548899346252455,0,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0,-0.018496331154174848,0,-0.18496331154174847,0,0,0.07398532461669939,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.036992662308349696,0.1109779869250491,-0.018496331154174848,0,-0.018496331154174848,0.09248165577087424,-0.036992662308349696,0.018496331154174848,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018496331154174848,0,0.16646698038757363,0,0,0,0.018496331154174848,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018496331154174848,0,0.31443762962097244,0,0.036992662308349696,0,0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0.036992662308349696,0,0,0,0.018496331154174848,0,0.05548899346252455,-0.018496331154174848,0,-0.05548899346252455,0,0,0.036992662308349696,0,0.036992662308349696,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0.018496331154174848,-0.036992662308349696,0,-0.036992662308349696,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.018496331154174848,0.018496331154174848,0,0.018496331154174848,-0.036992662308349696,0.018496331154174848,-0.036992662308349696,0.036992662308349696,-0.05548899346252455,0,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0.018496331154174848,-0.018496331154174848,0.05548899346252455,0,0,0,0.018496331154174848,0,0,-0.018496331154174848,0,-0.036992662308349696,0.018496331154174848,-0.036992662308349696,0.09248165577087424,0,0.018496331154174848,-0.05548899346252455,0.018496331154174848,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0.036992662308349696,0,0,0,0.018496331154174848,-0.14797064923339878,0,0,0,0,0.018496331154174848,-0.018496331154174848,0.018496331154174848,0,0.05548899346252455,-0.018496331154174848,0.036992662308349696,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0,0.1109779869250491,-0.036992662308349696,0.05548899346252455,-0.018496331154174848,0,-0.16646698038757363,0,0,0,-0.036992662308349696,0,-0.018496331154174848,0.07398532461669939,0,0,0,0.09248165577087424,0,0,0,0,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0,0.05548899346252455,0,0,0,0,-0.05548899346252455,0.036992662308349696,-0.018496331154174848,0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0.16646698038757363,0,0.05548899346252455,0,0,0,0,-0.09248165577087424,0,-0.036992662308349696,0,0,0,-0.036992662308349696,0,0,0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0.018496331154174848,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0.018496331154174848,0,0.018496331154174848,-0.018496331154174848,0.018496331154174848,0,0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0.036992662308349696,-0.036992662308349696,0,-0.018496331154174848,0,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0,0.018496331154174848,-0.036992662308349696,0.036992662308349696,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0.2774449673126227,-0.036992662308349696,0,-0.05548899346252455,0,-0.018496331154174848,0.05548899346252455,0,0.018496331154174848,-0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0,0.036992662308349696,-0.09248165577087424,0,0,0.018496331154174848,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-215-1","text":"> Well, the early molecular biology, the early molecular genetics, was really the science for a young man, because... and I really enjoyed it. And *C. elegans* (*Caenorhabditis elegans*) was... was a science that fitted by mature middle years, because it had a huge strategic component. That is, it wasn't something that you could go into the lab and do an experiment and get the answer the next day, but really needed the development of a... a lot of... techniques and a whole range of what I would call normal science. I mean, bringing the science of observation back to biology and getting the system into a form where in fact it could reap the benefits of the gene cloning that had been discovered about half way through its... its course.

Starting at the begin... at the beginning of the '70s. And of course the thing that came along and made it the subject was of course gene cloning. And that is what we turned our attention to, and that of course has been the answer to all of developmental biology, that you find out how the gene works by cloning it and looking up its sequence in a database and seeing if anybody's got anything like this before. And then you can take comfort in each other's ignorance, if you like. > > However, once that had gone forward and once it became clear that other people could do this probably better than I could, that is, I felt very much that my role in this had... had been completed.

I was very heavily involved in being the director of the lab and spending my time doing the accounts and trying to sort out budgets — really a total waste of time in my opinion — and I think it was the biggest mistake I ever made. > > However, what I came to realise now is that we had a new way of doing genetics. And that therefore instead of... of denying it, as many people thought... wanted to do, this was just going to be a whole new science, and if it was going to be a whole new science I want to be in it at the beginning. Now one of these was... there was this new way of doing genetics. The idea which was simply stated at the time when all of this came, is, let's go and get the whole sequence of a genome. Molecular genetics, if you like, classical molecular genetics was an extremely difficult way of reading the sequence of DNA. Now that we could do it directly, let's go and do it. And in principle we just have access to the total DNA. And that is what cloning DNA and sequencing it could give you. > > Therefore the classic approach to genetics could now take on a different... a different guise and what I thought immediately was it needs to be conducted with the same logic. And if you ask what does a geneticist want to know? He wants to know what are the genes? What do they do? How many do we have? How do they map onto phenotypic function? And how does he do this? Well, in classical genetics he collects mutants, because it is a paradigm of... it is the case of classical genetics that **you cannot assert the existence of a wild-type gene, that is a gene performing a normal function, until you have a mutation**, a deviant of it.

You hunt for mutants and then you classify them. The way you classify mutations is you put them into the same organism and you see whether they complement each other. If they fail to complement you can say those mutations are in the same gene. If they complement, you know you've got different genes. > > And so you can conduct this exercise and come out and just say well, for movement I think we've got to have at least 10 genes that specify movement because I have 10 genes of paralysed mutants that show lack of movement. And these genes then, it's now up to you to show how they work. That of course was the difficulty with developmental biology... is one didn't know how to get into the system until we could clone the genes. Right. > > Now, what we could now do was effectively clone genes, sequence them, therefore we... we didn't have to do the mutant hunt. We could actually find the wild-type genes, they were there. And then we could ask — it's been called reverse genetics, but it's wrong — then we could ask what happens if I make a defect in this gene? Right, now. And then I'll see what the effect is on the organism. **Basically what it is, it's not reverse genetics but it's inside-out**, because the whole history of biology we pursue functions from the outside, from the phenotype, from say, finding people that suffer, that have... that are bad at high altitude, to discover by going through that they have abnormal red blood cells, to show they have a protein that has an abnormal way of aggregating, to finally showing that there's the protein with one amino acid change, and that's the sickle cell mutation. And that took... decades to do. > > Now we can start at the other end, which is to find the wild-type gene, since we know the genetic codes we can just write down the protein. And since, as information collects about proteins and what they do, we may be able to... to get much faster to map this in terms of phenotypic function, right. So here's the new approach to genetics. **What does it do? It liberates us from the life-cycles of organisms.** We had been bound to always do crosses, always our experiments depended on taking genotypes apart, seeing what happens and putting them together and seeing what happens. One generation at all times. And of course when we got experimental organisms, they had to have easy life-cycles, they had to have rapid ones so we could do a lot of experiments... didn't have to wait a year or two years for the answer.

That is, to get overlapping clones of cosmids and John Sulston joined me and we worked at that point — he'd also got a bit fed up with the nematode at that point — and we worked then developing techniques for an organism called *Rhodopseudomonas blastica*. It was just some small bacterium. And having developed various fingerprinting techniques so that we could do this, John then thought that what he would do is just take this straight off into *C. elegans* (*Caenorhabditis elegans*), which is what he did. And we continued a little with technology for bacteria and with... we worked with *Rhizobium* and I have to say I'm still interested in that and I'm still doing experiments to find good ways of getting maps of bacteria very quickly... ordered DNA clones. > > However, when all of this got moving at the more public level, and it had all started when Sinsheimer called a meeting of people to which I didn't go, because I couldn't go, this was in 1986. And John Sulston and Bart Barrell who was a sequencer and who had done the whole of EBV — Epstein-Barr Virus — which was the largest genome done at that time, they went. And the idea was, which Wally Gilbert appeared as the... the leading inspirer, the chief optimist, if you like... was that we should... the Holy Grail was to just sequence the whole of the human genome. > > Now, I think that that was... I mean, there was no technology and there still is today no technology that would allow us to do this in some reasonable time. And I got very heavily involved into the... the human genome programs, I got onto the American committee on this to decide where it is, and that history has been written over and over again. But the important thing to realise is that there was first of all gigantic antagonism of... of the scientists to this project. The... there's antagonism in that the way it was pictured was there'd be a factory somewhere that would generate sequences, right. And such factories are not... they are viable, but not in the context of science. That is, I... I still have to convince scientists that there are people in the world who would do this work, it's a job. They wouldn't be interested in the result. Because what they'd be interested in is the money, so that on Friday afternoon they can take that money and then go and pursue their interests, like have boats or gardens or so on. Scientists don't imagine that there are people like this. They think everybody is a student with a kind of right... inalienable right to be a genius, and that this would actually clamp him, and it's just not true, there are lots of people happy at their work. > > In fact, I thought we could actually do this by having something that was like **a bingo hall**. That is we could have these machines and we could put up the sequence of the day, people would actually pay to come and operate these machines and we'd have a prize. So it would cost you £10 to operate the machine, but if you happened to get the sequence of the day there'd be a prize of a £1000. And I think we'd be deluged with people wanting to come and play the machines, and we could put these up in shopping malls and supermarkets, we'd just get the sequence done very easily. And indeed, you know, although there are three billion base pairs, you realise in principle it could be done in an afternoon, let us say, by the population of China. Of course there's a bit of a problem organising the population to do it, but each would only have to do three of them, you see, of course. > > But so, I thought we needed... that showed very clearly that the perception of people as to what was understood by scientific work was... did seem to me to be very different. And everybody complained that this is going to be... bring in big science. You know, and everybody would be enslaved in some way. And of course... and... and then of course the real motives occurred, it would divert money from them. So the real issue about whether this could be funded or not — the project, the human genome project — is that it had to satisfy some kind of threshold of new money, so that it wouldn't be taking it away from the people, otherwise there would be screams and shouts, and that's really what all the politics was about. Where can you get new money?","section":218,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.13128634364836603,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06059369706847663,0,0,0,0.010098949511412771,-0.05049474755706385,0,-0.040395798045651084,0.010098949511412771,-0.010098949511412771,0.030296848534238315,0,0.1009894951141277,-0.010098949511412771,0.010098949511412771,-0.0706926465798894,0,0,0.020197899022825542,0,0.4746506270364002,0,0,-0.020197899022825542,0,-0.05049474755706385,0.020197899022825542,0,0.2524737377853193,0,0.4039579804565108,-0.030296848534238315,0.020197899022825542,0,0.010098949511412771,0,0,0,0.010098949511412771,-0.030296848534238315,0,0,0.05049474755706385,0,0.010098949511412771,-0.010098949511412771,0,0,0.010098949511412771,-0.010098949511412771,0.020197899022825542,-0.010098949511412771,0.010098949511412771,0,0.040395798045651084,-0.010098949511412771,0.010098949511412771,-0.020197899022825542,0,-0.020197899022825542,0,0,0,0,0,-0.020197899022825542,0,0,0,0,0.030296848534238315,-0.020197899022825542,0.040395798045651084,0,0,0,0,0,0.010098949511412771,0,0,0,0.020197899022825542,-0.040395798045651084,0.030296848534238315,0,0,-0.010098949511412771,0.05049474755706385,-0.020197899022825542,0.040395798045651084,-0.020197899022825542,0,0,0.05049474755706385,-0.020197899022825542,0.05049474755706385,0,0,-0.010098949511412771,0,-0.010098949511412771,0,0,0.030296848534238315,0,0.040395798045651084,-0.010098949511412771,0.0706926465798894,0,0,0,0.010098949511412771,-0.010098949511412771,0.040395798045651084,-0.06059369706847663,0.010098949511412771,-0.020197899022825542,0,-0.010098949511412771,0.010098949511412771,-0.13128634364836603,0,-0.010098949511412771,0.030296848534238315,0,0.010098949511412771,-0.010098949511412771,0.010098949511412771,-0.010098949511412771,0,-0.010098949511412771,0.06059369706847663,0,0,-0.030296848534238315,0.020197899022825542,-0.020197899022825542,0.010098949511412771,-0.010098949511412771,0,0,0,-0.020197899022825542,0.040395798045651084,0,0,0,0.010098949511412771,-0.010098949511412771,0.1413852931597788,0,0.040395798045651084,0,0,-0.030296848534238315,0,-0.010098949511412771,0,-0.030296848534238315,0,0,0.020197899022825542,-0.010098949511412771,0.30296848534238313,-0.040395798045651084,0,-0.020197899022825542,0.020197899022825542,-0.010098949511412771,0,0,0.020197899022825542,0,0.040395798045651084,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.020197899022825542,0.09089054560271494,-0.010098949511412771,0.05049474755706385,-0.010098949511412771,0,-0.020197899022825542,0.010098949511412771,0,0,-0.020197899022825542,0.010098949511412771,-0.010098949511412771,0,0,0.010098949511412771,-0.06059369706847663,0,-0.05049474755706385,0,-0.040395798045651084,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05049474755706385,0.020197899022825542,0,0,-0.020197899022825542,0.010098949511412771,-0.13128634364836603,0.010098949511412771,-0.05049474755706385,0.020197899022825542,-0.030296848534238315,0,-0.020197899022825542,0.020197899022825542,-0.020197899022825542,0,0,0,0,0.010098949511412771,0,0,0,0.030296848534238315,0,0.010098949511412771,-0.040395798045651084,0.16158319218260433,0,0,-0.020197899022825542,0,-0.010098949511412771,0,-0.010098949511412771,0.010098949511412771,0,0,0,0,-0.0706926465798894,0,-0.010098949511412771,0,0,0.020197899022825542,-0.010098949511412771,0.030296848534238315,0,0.030296848534238315,-0.010098949511412771,0.05049474755706385,0,0.010098949511412771,-0.010098949511412771,0.020197899022825542,0,0.13128634364836603,-0.030296848534238315,0.040395798045651084,-0.010098949511412771,0,-0.13128634364836603,0,-0.020197899022825542,0,-0.020197899022825542,0,0,0.030296848534238315,-0.010098949511412771,0.010098949511412771,0,0.030296848534238315,-0.010098949511412771,0,-0.010098949511412771,0,0,0,-0.010098949511412771,0.010098949511412771,-0.1413852931597788,0.010098949511412771,-0.010098949511412771,0,-0.020197899022825542,0.010098949511412771,-0.06059369706847663,0,0,0.010098949511412771,0,0,0,0.06059369706847663,0,0.010098949511412771,0,0,0,0,0,0.030296848534238315,-0.010098949511412771,0,-0.020197899022825542,0,-0.010098949511412771,0.05049474755706385,0,0,0,0.020197899022825542,-0.010098949511412771,0,-0.030296848534238315,0,0,0,-0.010098949511412771,0,-0.010098949511412771,0.010098949511412771,0,0.010098949511412771,-0.020197899022825542,0.020197899022825542,0,0.0706926465798894,-0.020197899022825542,0.010098949511412771,0,0.010098949511412771,-0.030296848534238315,0.010098949511412771,0,0.040395798045651084,-0.010098949511412771,0.12118739413695326,-0.020197899022825542,0.05049474755706385,-0.040395798045651084,0,-0.010098949511412771,0.32316638436520867,-0.08079159609130217,0.010098949511412771,-0.010098949511412771,0,-0.010098949511412771,0.09089054560271494,0,0.010098949511412771,-0.040395798045651084,0.010098949511412771,0,0,0,0.05049474755706385,-0.030296848534238315,0,0,0.020197899022825542,0,0,-0.020197899022825542,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-219-1","text":"> Now, I had by this time, by 1986, decided… had left the MRC [Medical Research Council], the... the Laboratory of Molecular Biology although I was still physically housed in it and I had a unit of my own, which I decided I would do the human genome in the UK, for the simple reason that I'd just been given a Jeantet Award which had a research fund of about £300,000 which I could use any way I liked. And so I had this — I've still got some of this money left actually — and so I started to hire people and we began to pursue our approach to it. > > And our approach was not to attempt to sequence the human genome, but to do it in the old way of looking for the genes. Now, the best way to look at genes was of, course, to look at their copies, cDNA. And the idea was, well, let's go and start to characterise cDNAs and sequence them, because each of those is a gene, and then what we should do is to put them on the map. > > Now, mapping became the dominant thing and mapping was wrong. Let me just… the reason it was wrong, from the point of view of a pure geneticist like myself, the map is — just happens to be one way to index the mutants — **the map is only required if you wish to operate on that organism in the real world**, if you want to understand human genetic disease or you want to breed better plants, you need genetic maps. But **if you want to understand human biology you need genes**. And we could accomplish both by finding genes and putting them on a map. It seemed to me to be such a straightforward thing, to construct what I said right at the beginning was: let's construct **a gene map**, because that's what geneticists do. > > No, we had to have enormous discussions as to whether this was going to be a physical map or a genetic map or… or this kind of map, or… or the other. There's only one map that you need, which is where… how… **give us the genes and tell us where they are.

I think the Americans did create it, did turn it into a… did make it banal — that's the only word that I could use — by commercialising it, but the project still remains. But what I thought I would do is go and do something different. > > And so I had come to the conclusion a long time ago that the human genome was full of junk. And I propagated this widely, making very carefully the distinction between the two kinds of rubbish, namely, **junk which is rubbish that is kept, and garbage that is rubbish that is thrown out**. It turns out that most languages use two distinctive words to… to specify this kind of rubbish. In Japanese it's *Gomi*, which is dust, rubbish you throw out, and *Garacuta* which is junk that you keep. And… and of course you… **if there is rubbish in your genome, it must be junk because if it were garbage it wouldn't be there**. > > So by trying to press this and by trying to persuade people that this problem has to be done in stages, because I would be asked questions at lectures, how do you know there isn't any… there's nothing important in the junk? And aren't you worried? And I would say, no, I'm not worried at all, because **I believe in leaving problems to the next generation**. So you may be worried, but not me. I'm not worried at all. > > So I think by trying to get a perspective of what we should do first and not worry about what we were going to do at the end of the day, that is… that is… and I therefore felt that it was… I must try and do something different. So I asked the question, which is a question I've always asked myself: **is there an animal somewhere, that may not have acquired all this junk?** You know, a vertebrate. Not a pervertebrate, but a vertebrate that hasn't acquired this junk. And of course, easy to ask the question if you know the answer. And of course it's easy to ask the question if you know the answer. > > And I knew the answer, because at Woods Hole in the late '60s I had taught courses which was essentially on the C paradox, it worried me... worried me that there seemed to be organisms that had too much DNA. And as part of this I did a… I rotted my mind by reading in the fantastic library of the Woods Hole… the Woods Hole Ocean… the Woods Hole Marine Bio Lab. And I'd… and I knew of the journal because I'd been a reader of it for many years. It's a journal which I say is not a nudist magazine, it's called *The American Naturalist*, and it's a… and in this there were these… there were these papers by Heingardner. Heingardner had measured the DNA content of many species of fish. > > And this paper, published in 1968, it's 25 years ago, I knew — I had a copy of it, right — and I knew there were fish. Now, not only did I know that these were fish, but in fact, that fact had been widely… it was published, it's published in a calendar that had been given out by a company selling instruments. It's in many textbooks. > > *[Q] Sydney, I'm terribly sorry, you haven't told us what is the material.* > > The fish is that — what they had shown is that amongst all of these fish, there were **fish which had DNA contents about a 10th of that of man**, it's an 8th of that of man, eight times smaller genomes. Now, at the time, if you asked anybody, what do you think about this fish with eight times less DNA than man, the answer was, that's clearly all the fish deserve. And I reckon they are, you know… I reckon I'm eight times more complicated than this fish. So we had no idea of what all this DNA content meant then, we were only at the beginnings of repetitive DNA and so on. > > And a second paper was published in 1983 which was a cot curve on a similar group, members of fish, that was published there — I knew about that — and that showed also that the cot curves are remarkably like that that John Sulston and I did with *C. elegans* [*Caenorhabditis elegans*] which has very little repetitive DNA — 90% unique. So I thought, **it's possible to do — this fish may be the right thing to do**.","section":220,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.07139141355713496,0,0.02039754673060999,0,0,-0.010198773365304996,0.030596320095914988,0,0.07139141355713496,0,0.02039754673060999,0,0.010198773365304996,-0.02039754673060999,0.010198773365304996,0,0.010198773365304996,0,0.13258405374896495,0,0.16318037384487993,-0.010198773365304996,0.010198773365304996,-0.14278282711426993,0.010198773365304996,-0.010198773365304996,0.030596320095914988,-0.02039754673060999,0.4997398948999448,0,0,-0.010198773365304996,0.010198773365304996,-0.030596320095914988,0.02039754673060999,0,0.20397546730609992,0,0.29576442759384486,-0.010198773365304996,0,0,0,-0.010198773365304996,0,0,0,-0.02039754673060999,0.010198773365304996,0,0.07139141355713496,0,0.04079509346121998,0,0.010198773365304996,0,0,0,0,0,0.010198773365304996,-0.02039754673060999,0.11218650701835495,-0.030596320095914988,0.010198773365304996,-0.030596320095914988,0.02039754673060999,-0.010198773365304996,0.010198773365304996,-0.04079509346121998,0,0,0,-0.010198773365304996,0,-0.061192640191829975,0,0,0,0,0.030596320095914988,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.010198773365304996,0,0,-0.030596320095914988,0.010198773365304996,-0.030596320095914988,0,0,0.010198773365304996,-0.02039754673060999,0.09178896028774497,0,0,0,0.02039754673060999,0,0.010198773365304996,0,0.010198773365304996,0,0,0,0,-0.010198773365304996,0.030596320095914988,0,0.02039754673060999,0,0.04079509346121998,0,0,-0.010198773365304996,0.02039754673060999,-0.010198773365304996,0.02039754673060999,-0.010198773365304996,0,-0.010198773365304996,0,-0.02039754673060999,0,-0.17337914721018494,0,0,0,-0.010198773365304996,0,0,0,0,0.010198773365304996,0,0.05099386682652498,0,0.010198773365304996,-0.030596320095914988,0.02039754673060999,-0.010198773365304996,0,-0.010198773365304996,0.010198773365304996,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14278282711426993,0,0,0,0.030596320095914988,-0.061192640191829975,0,-0.02039754673060999,0.010198773365304996,-0.030596320095914988,0,-0.02039754673060999,0.061192640191829975,0,0.39775216124689483,0,0,0,0,-0.02039754673060999,0,0,0.05099386682652498,-0.030596320095914988,0.010198773365304996,-0.010198773365304996,0.010198773365304996,-0.02039754673060999,0,-0.010198773365304996,0,0,0.010198773365304996,-0.010198773365304996,0.010198773365304996,-0.010198773365304996,0.030596320095914988,0,0.02039754673060999,0,0.010198773365304996,0,0.010198773365304996,-0.010198773365304996,0.02039754673060999,0,0.010198773365304996,-0.02039754673060999,0.010198773365304996,0,0,-0.04079509346121998,0,-0.010198773365304996,0,0,0,-0.010198773365304996,0.02039754673060999,0,0,-0.05099386682652498,0,-0.12238528038365995,0,-0.08159018692243997,0,-0.010198773365304996,0,-0.11218650701835495,0.010198773365304996,0,0,0,0.010198773365304996,0,0,-0.010198773365304996,0,0,0,-0.030596320095914988,0,0,0.08159018692243997,0,0,-0.010198773365304996,0.010198773365304996,0,0.02039754673060999,-0.010198773365304996,0,-0.010198773365304996,0.010198773365304996,-0.010198773365304996,0.010198773365304996,-0.02039754673060999,0,0,0.010198773365304996,0,0,0,0.05099386682652498,0,0.04079509346121998,-0.07139141355713496,0.08159018692243997,-0.07139141355713496,0,-0.02039754673060999,0,0,0.2345717874020149,-0.010198773365304996,0,0,0.010198773365304996,-0.16318037384487993,0.010198773365304996,0,0,0,0,0,0.010198773365304996,0,0,0,0,-0.010198773365304996,0,-0.010198773365304996,0.010198773365304996,-0.010198773365304996,0.02039754673060999,-0.02039754673060999,0.02039754673060999,-0.04079509346121998,0.04079509346121998,0,0.030596320095914988,0,0,-0.09178896028774497,0.010198773365304996,0,0.010198773365304996,0,0,0,0.010198773365304996,0,0.030596320095914988,0,0,-0.010198773365304996,0.010198773365304996,-0.010198773365304996,0.010198773365304996,-0.02039754673060999,0.010198773365304996,0,0,-0.04079509346121998,0.061192640191829975,-0.010198773365304996,0,0,0,0,0,-0.010198773365304996,0,-0.010198773365304996,0,0,0.010198773365304996,-0.02039754673060999,0.030596320095914988,-0.010198773365304996,0,-0.02039754673060999,0.010198773365304996,0,0.030596320095914988,-0.02039754673060999,0.02039754673060999,-0.010198773365304996,0,0,0,0,0.04079509346121998,0,0.030596320095914988,-0.02039754673060999,0.030596320095914988,-0.02039754673060999,0.010198773365304996,0,0.2651681074979299,-0.04079509346121998,0.010198773365304996,-0.02039754673060999,0,-0.010198773365304996,0.010198773365304996,-0.010198773365304996,0,-0.010198773365304996,0,-0.010198773365304996,0.02039754673060999,-0.010198773365304996,0.010198773365304996,-0.07139141355713496,0,0,0.030596320095914988,0,0,-0.010198773365304996,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-221-1","text":"> Now, I tried to get these fish for quite some time. They are **puffer fish**. And I then decided that such is the… such is the unreliability of natural sources that we could start to work on this and find that some pollution or some fire or… or something has… has got rid of them in the world, they've become extinct. Actually today we now say that we don't care if they become extinct as long as we've got enough DNA to keep us going, or we've cloned it all. > > So, I then decided that I would go and get the one specimen of this fish which is actually fished and cultivated for food, in Japan. And it is the **fugu — the Japanese puffer fish**. Now, when I went to Japan and — to try to organise this — and I managed to organise this and people said, why are you interested in this? I said, I'll give you a little talk on junk. Nobody believed this, they said it's… the measurements must be wrong. It can't be that you have something with so little DNA, the measurements must be wrong. > > Well, to cut the long story short, we got this, I managed to find a group of young people to work with me, and we were able to devise a fairly reasonable way, because of course what you want to try and prove is that **this fish has the same number of genes as we do**, because if it only has 1/8 the number of genes it isn't interesting. And that we were able to do by what I think's a very pretty experiment. What we did is we just did — it's a new technique called **statistical genomics** — we just took 600 pieces of DNA randomly and sequenced them, and asked, how many genes can we find? That is genes that have already been found in other vertebrates and in particular in the mammals, that occupy most of this. And having found the probability of finding these genes we could then go and ask — because we didn't have to do the experiment — because we could then calculate what is the abundance of these genes in the genome. And what we found is it was eight times more enriched in the fugu, therefore, what we could prove is that **we had the same number of genes, more or less**, and everything we've done has borne that out. > > So I think I like to call the fugu **the discount genome**, because you get 90% discount on sequencing. And since I think I've enhanced the job tenfold, then I've fulfilled the great technical requirement which everybody said we should have, a tenfold step in technology every five years, and so I've done that in a few months **just by choosing the right organism**. > > Now, I think that this will now become a world-wide use. We have now a lot of people coming to our lab to… to find pieces of DNA that correspond to this, and I'm encouraging as many people to work on this, because… > > *[Q] Could you explain why it's so helpful?* > > Well, if you… to explain why it's so helpful is the following. Let us just assume that certain groups of genes have stayed together throughout this whole period of about a half a billion years of evolution. Now, many people can map a human gene, let's say a gene for breast cancer, but they can only find it into a piece of DNA, somewhere in a piece of DNA that's a million base pairs. Right. Now, to sequence through the million base pairs and find the gene is enormously tedious and time consuming. Right? And what we are saying is, well, you'll only have to do a 100,000, a 125,000, because what you do is you start with something on this, go and get the piece of the fugu genome and then move along. > > And let me just say that whereas on the average **a gene in man is 50,000 bases, the gene in fugu is 6,000 bases**, and in fact we have now got pieces of DNA which is 40,000 base — it's called a cosmid — and on this we have as many as eight genes. Seven to eight genes is the popular thing. Therefore, what we find is that all the intervening sequences are there, they're in the same place so these are the same genes, but they are small, very tiny, and also the genes are close together. They're not separated by large amounts of junk DNA.","section":221,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.03177673713936822,-0.01059224571312274,0,0,0,-0.01059224571312274,0,0,0,-0.01059224571312274,0.01059224571312274,0,0.01059224571312274,-0.06355347427873644,0,0,0,0,0.02118449142624548,0,0.09533021141810466,-0.03177673713936822,0,-0.07414571999185918,0.02118449142624548,-0.12710694855747287,0,0,0.4766510570905233,0,0.01059224571312274,-0.0529612285656137,0,-0.02118449142624548,0,0,0.26480614282806847,-0.02118449142624548,0.32835961710680495,0,0,-0.03177673713936822,0,0,0,0,0.01059224571312274,-0.02118449142624548,0,-0.02118449142624548,0.08473796570498192,0,0.02118449142624548,0,0,-0.01059224571312274,0,-0.04236898285249096,0,-0.04236898285249096,0,-0.02118449142624548,0.04236898285249096,0,0,-0.03177673713936822,0.04236898285249096,0,0.0529612285656137,-0.01059224571312274,0,-0.0529612285656137,0,-0.01059224571312274,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01059224571312274,0.13769919427059563,0,0.02118449142624548,0,0,0,0.02118449142624548,0,0,0,0,-0.0529612285656137,0.01059224571312274,-0.01059224571312274,0.01059224571312274,-0.03177673713936822,0.0529612285656137,0,0.03177673713936822,-0.02118449142624548,0,0,0.02118449142624548,0,0.02118449142624548,-0.01059224571312274,0.01059224571312274,0,0.01059224571312274,0,0.01059224571312274,-0.01059224571312274,0.07414571999185918,0,0,0,0.0529612285656137,-0.01059224571312274,0,-0.02118449142624548,0,0,0.04236898285249096,-0.09533021141810466,0,0,0,0,0,-0.16947593140996384,0,0,0.08473796570498192,0,0,0,0.03177673713936822,-0.04236898285249096,0.01059224571312274,0,0.02118449142624548,-0.03177673713936822,0.03177673713936822,-0.02118449142624548,0.03177673713936822,0,0,-0.02118449142624548,0,0,0.01059224571312274,0,0,0,0,0,0.02118449142624548,0,0.1588836856968411,0,0.03177673713936822,-0.01059224571312274,0.04236898285249096,-0.0529612285656137,0,0,0,-0.02118449142624548,0.01059224571312274,-0.01059224571312274,0,0,0.2330294056887003,-0.04236898285249096,0,-0.01059224571312274,0,-0.02118449142624548,0.01059224571312274,0,0.02118449142624548,-0.01059224571312274,0.01059224571312274,0,0,0,0,-0.01059224571312274,0,0,0.06355347427873644,0,0.02118449142624548,0,0,-0.01059224571312274,0.07414571999185918,0,0,0,0.02118449142624548,0,0.01059224571312274,0,0.02118449142624548,-0.07414571999185918,0,0,0,-0.01059224571312274,0,-0.02118449142624548,0,-0.01059224571312274,0,-0.04236898285249096,0.03177673713936822,0,0,-0.09533021141810466,0.03177673713936822,-0.01059224571312274,0.04236898285249096,-0.06355347427873644,0.01059224571312274,0,0,-0.0529612285656137,0,-0.04236898285249096,0,0,0,0,0.02118449142624548,-0.01059224571312274,0,-0.02118449142624548,0,-0.01059224571312274,0,-0.03177673713936822,0.01059224571312274,0,0,0,0.02118449142624548,-0.02118449142624548,0,0,0.01059224571312274,0,0.01059224571312274,0,0,-0.08473796570498192,0,-0.01059224571312274,0,0,0.01059224571312274,-0.03177673713936822,0.03177673713936822,0,0.04236898285249096,-0.01059224571312274,0.01059224571312274,-0.02118449142624548,0.01059224571312274,-0.0529612285656137,0.03177673713936822,0,0.12710694855747287,-0.01059224571312274,0.03177673713936822,0,0,-0.20125266854933205,0,0,0,-0.01059224571312274,0,0,0.06355347427873644,-0.03177673713936822,0.02118449142624548,0,0.03177673713936822,-0.01059224571312274,0.01059224571312274,-0.01059224571312274,0,0,0,0,0.03177673713936822,-0.2965828799674367,0.01059224571312274,0,0,0,0,-0.11651470284435014,0,0,0.02118449142624548,0,0,0,0,0,0.01059224571312274,0,0,0,0.01059224571312274,0,0,-0.01059224571312274,0,-0.01059224571312274,0,-0.04236898285249096,0.02118449142624548,0,0,0,0.01059224571312274,-0.01059224571312274,0,-0.03177673713936822,0,0,0.01059224571312274,-0.01059224571312274,0.02118449142624548,0,0.01059224571312274,0,0,0,0,0,0.02118449142624548,-0.04236898285249096,0.07414571999185918,0,0,0,0,0,0.03177673713936822,0,0.01059224571312274,-0.0529612285656137,0.04236898285249096,-0.03177673713936822,0,0,0.26480614282806847,-0.03177673713936822,0.01059224571312274,-0.03177673713936822,0,0,0.0529612285656137,0,0,-0.02118449142624548,0,0,0.01059224571312274,0,0.06355347427873644,-0.13769919427059563,0,-0.01059224571312274,0,0,0.01059224571312274,0,0.01059224571312274,0]},{"id":"transcript-222-1","text":"> Well, the fish… fish gene is about 1/8 the size of the human gene. We have sequenced many of these and compared them with the human gene, and in all cases find the same number of introns, but **the introns are tiny in the fish**, and whereas they can be enormous in… in the human or mammalian gene. And one of the things that of course would be important is exactly how — what's called in the trade synteny, but synteny is on a much larger scale, that means on the same chromosome, on the same chunk of DNA; I like to call this contiguity, because it's going to be on a small scale — to what extent this has been conserved. And we have growing evidence that this is conserved over reasonable distances. > > A rough calculation showed us that it might be conserved over about **a million base pairs of human DNA**, and… which would be equivalent to a **100,000 base pairs of fugu DNA**, and it may be of that order or even better. So this enables you to go and find human genes simply by using the fish, and it also enables you to actually go and characterise human genes, which are enormous. > > For example, the gene that's affected in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, dystrophin, is **2.8 mega bases, that is 2… nearly 3 million base pairs**. Whereas the parts… the part that we have already sequenced has been **reduced by a factor of 20 in size**, and so that if the whole thing were to follow the rest of it — which we're still doing — were to follow this, then the fish gene would be of the order of about 150,000 base pairs, which means we could characterise it. > > Which means that **we could characterise genes very quickly**. Now, I think a large number of people will come to use this, and in fact I do not want to set up a big institute to do this, but in fact I think it should be dispersed. I think the technology does not exist yet to… to tackle sequences as large as 400… genomes as large as 400 million base pairs, and until that develops we want a lot of people to come and get the benefit from this. It will also help us — following the Talleyrand principle which is: never do for yourself that which you can get other people to do for you — it will also help us to get a lot more information on this.

And of course we know this, because we find fossils of fish going back half a billion years and don't find human fossils. So we know that this fish looks more like this. > > And hence although it has… the genome has been exposed in time to the same forces that the human genome, that is to the same forces of mutation and nucleotide substitution and so on, we can say that if we take genes from the fish and compare them with the human, in one sense **we are looking across a half a billion years of the past**. If you like, the fish has preserved in a fossil form the genome of a fossil fish in its present form. It's fossilised the genomes there, right, with what it is. But that tells us also that we can now find out what happened in evolution. Or at least we can make a good approximation to it. > > Now, let… to try to explain this, let us suppose I were to start a new genetic program and I wrote a grant saying I am now really interested in… in really interesting mutations; so I want to get a fish, I want to put it in the lab, and I want to make mutants and **I want to turn it into a man**. Because that's the only really interesting thing, nobody else is interested in anything else, because that's a… that's all we have to explain, is how fish became men in the course of time. And, of course, you know… you know you're a little fish at some point of your own development, you've got little gills and so on. So we could at least have tried to explain how you went on from being a little fish to being a little man.","section":223,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.01569218809786242,0,0,0,0,-0.03138437619572484,0,0,0.0784609404893121,0,0,0,0,-0.01569218809786242,0.01569218809786242,-0.01569218809786242,0,0,0.03138437619572484,0,0,-0.03138437619572484,0,-0.0941531285871745,0.01569218809786242,-0.03138437619572484,0.01569218809786242,0,0.4707656429358726,-0.01569218809786242,0.01569218809786242,0,0,0,0.06276875239144968,-0.01569218809786242,0.42368907864228533,0,0.21969063337007386,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04707656429358725,-0.04707656429358725,0,0,0.01569218809786242,0,0,-0.01569218809786242,0.01569218809786242,0,0,0,0,-0.04707656429358725,0,-0.03138437619572484,0.01569218809786242,-0.01569218809786242,0,-0.0941531285871745,0.04707656429358725,0,0,0,0,-0.03138437619572484,0,-0.01569218809786242,0,-0.01569218809786242,0.01569218809786242,0,0.03138437619572484,-0.03138437619572484,0.04707656429358725,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03138437619572484,0,0,0.01569218809786242,-0.03138437619572484,0.04707656429358725,0,0.03138437619572484,-0.03138437619572484,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01569218809786242,0,0,0.01569218809786242,0,0.12553750478289935,-0.01569218809786242,0,-0.01569218809786242,0,0,0.12553750478289935,-0.06276875239144968,0.03138437619572484,-0.03138437619572484,0,-0.01569218809786242,0,-0.0941531285871745,0,-0.01569218809786242,0.03138437619572484,-0.03138437619572484,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01569218809786242,0.04707656429358725,-0.03138437619572484,0.03138437619572484,-0.01569218809786242,0,-0.03138437619572484,0,0,0,-0.03138437619572484,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.20399844527221145,0,0,0,0,-0.03138437619572484,0.01569218809786242,0,0,0,0,0,0.0941531285871745,0,0.26676719766366114,-0.03138437619572484,0,-0.0784609404893121,0,0,0,0,0.01569218809786242,0,0.06276875239144968,-0.01569218809786242,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03138437619572484,0,0.01569218809786242,0,0,0,0.01569218809786242,0,0,0,0,0,0.01569218809786242,0,0,-0.03138437619572484,0,0,0,0,0.01569218809786242,-0.03138437619572484,0,0,0,-0.01569218809786242,0.01569218809786242,0,0,-0.04707656429358725,0.04707656429358725,-0.01569218809786242,0,-0.01569218809786242,0,0,0,-0.21969063337007386,0.01569218809786242,-0.04707656429358725,0,0,0,0,0.03138437619572484,-0.01569218809786242,0.01569218809786242,-0.01569218809786242,0.01569218809786242,-0.06276875239144968,0.04707656429358725,-0.03138437619572484,0.04707656429358725,0,0,-0.04707656429358725,0,0,0,0,0.03138437619572484,0,0.01569218809786242,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01569218809786242,0,-0.01569218809786242,0.04707656429358725,0,0.04707656429358725,-0.01569218809786242,0,0,0,-0.0941531285871745,0.01569218809786242,0,0.10984531668503693,-0.01569218809786242,0.03138437619572484,-0.01569218809786242,0,-0.14122969288076176,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01569218809786242,0,-0.29815157385938595,0.01569218809786242,-0.01569218809786242,0,0,0,-0.10984531668503693,0,0,0,-0.01569218809786242,0.04707656429358725,0,0.04707656429358725,0,0,0,0.01569218809786242,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01569218809786242,0.01569218809786242,0,0,0,0,0,0.01569218809786242,0,0,-0.01569218809786242,0,0,0.01569218809786242,0,0.01569218809786242,0,0,-0.03138437619572484,0.01569218809786242,0,0.06276875239144968,-0.06276875239144968,0.06276875239144968,0,0,0,0,0,0.04707656429358725,0,0.01569218809786242,-0.06276875239144968,0.04707656429358725,-0.03138437619572484,0,0,0.188306257174349,-0.03138437619572484,0.01569218809786242,0,0,0,0,0,0.01569218809786242,0,0,0,0.03138437619572484,0,0,-0.0941531285871745,0,0,0.04707656429358725,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-224-1","text":"> And of course, if I did this no one would give me an absolute penny. But you see, it's already being done for us. Those experiments have been done, we've got the mutants, we've got the human mutants and we still have some representative of the original stock, the fish. Therefore, why don't we just do genetics on these? So why don't I just do the following, I'll take a gene out of the fish and put it into a man. Well, can't do that, so I'll do it in a mouse, which is the experimental animal. > > And now I'll ask for that gene, do you work in the mouse? Now, the mouse, of course, could be argued from point of view of physiology and anatomy to have a fishy part and to have something that got added on. There still is a fishy part to the mouse. The immunology will still be fishy; no, but the lungs certainly won't be, because they just aren't present in this. So if I find this gene, let us say, that expresses in the lungs of a human and I find the same gene in a fish, I can ask whether that fish gene will express in the lungs. Now, if it doesn't — so this only will express in the fishy part of the mouse — I have to say that that gene just retains that information, all right, and therefore I should look at the mouse gene there to see what has happened here. Has other things been added on? Has it moved to another place, perhaps, where it has a different regulation? That's probably what would have happened. > > Then in the other case, **if the fishy gene expresses all over the mouse**, that is you couldn't tell the difference between the two mice, one with a mouse gene and one with a fish gene, **then I have the right to say that evolution went at a higher level** in the program and this remained the same. So what we can find throughout these is those invariant parts of the genome that just stayed the same and which we expect will be… will be invariant in the sense that as we all know, in development, when you want a new muscle you don't start from the beginning again and reinvent all the proteins, you just have a way of saying: do what you know, but do it here and not there. > > So I think that this is the way really to do the genetics of complex regulation. And I think the present idea of doing it by cutting out a piece and seeing what happens, this is… this is going to be just too tedious and too boring to do.","section":224,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.09557582003990565,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03185860667996855,0,0,0,0,-0.015929303339984276,0,0,0,0,0.03185860667996855,0,0.17522233673982704,-0.015929303339984276,0,-0.09557582003990565,0.03185860667996855,-0.03185860667996855,0.015929303339984276,0,0.6531014369393553,0,0.015929303339984276,0,0,0,0.015929303339984276,0,0.15929303339984274,-0.04778791001995283,0.2548688534397484,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.015929303339984276,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.015929303339984276,-0.015929303339984276,0,-0.03185860667996855,0,-0.04778791001995283,0,0,0.03185860667996855,-0.015929303339984276,0,0,0,0,0.1274344267198742,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04778791001995283,0,0,0,-0.015929303339984276,0.20708094341979558,0,0.015929303339984276,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03185860667996855,0,-0.015929303339984276,0,-0.015929303339984276,0.015929303339984276,0,0.03185860667996855,0,0,0,0.015929303339984276,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04778791001995283,0,0,0.015929303339984276,-0.015929303339984276,0.015929303339984276,-0.03185860667996855,0,-0.03185860667996855,0,0,0.04778791001995283,-0.1274344267198742,0,0,0,-0.03185860667996855,0,-0.1274344267198742,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.015929303339984276,0,-0.015929303339984276,0.04778791001995283,-0.07964651669992137,0,-0.015929303339984276,0.03185860667996855,-0.04778791001995283,0,0,0,0,0.03185860667996855,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17522233673982704,0,0,-0.015929303339984276,0.015929303339984276,-0.03185860667996855,0.015929303339984276,0,0,-0.015929303339984276,0,-0.015929303339984276,0.0637172133599371,0,0.22301024675977987,-0.04778791001995283,0,-0.03185860667996855,0,0,0,0,0.03185860667996855,-0.015929303339984276,0,-0.03185860667996855,0,0,0,0,0.015929303339984276,0,0.015929303339984276,0,0.03185860667996855,0,0,0,0.03185860667996855,0,0,0,0,0,0.03185860667996855,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04778791001995283,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03185860667996855,0,0,-0.015929303339984276,0,-0.04778791001995283,0,-0.14336373005985847,0,0,0,-0.07964651669992137,0,-0.07964651669992137,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03185860667996855,0,0.015929303339984276,-0.04778791001995283,0.015929303339984276,-0.015929303339984276,0,0,0,-0.03185860667996855,0,0,0.015929303339984276,0,0.015929303339984276,0,0,0,0,-0.015929303339984276,0,0,0,0,0.03185860667996855,-0.015929303339984276,0.0637172133599371,0,0.04778791001995283,-0.015929303339984276,0.015929303339984276,0,0,-0.015929303339984276,0.0637172133599371,0,0.1274344267198742,-0.015929303339984276,0,0,0.04778791001995283,-0.11150512337988994,0,-0.015929303339984276,0,-0.015929303339984276,0,0,0.015929303339984276,-0.015929303339984276,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.015929303339984276,0,0,0,-0.11150512337988994,0.015929303339984276,0,0,0,0,-0.07964651669992137,0,-0.015929303339984276,0,-0.03185860667996855,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.015929303339984276,-0.03185860667996855,0.0637172133599371,-0.03185860667996855,0,0,0.015929303339984276,0,0,0,0,0,0.015929303339984276,0,0.015929303339984276,-0.03185860667996855,0.015929303339984276,0,0,0,0.0637172133599371,0,0.07964651669992137,-0.03185860667996855,0.04778791001995283,0,0,-0.015929303339984276,0,-0.015929303339984276,0.04778791001995283,0,0.04778791001995283,-0.0637172133599371,0.03185860667996855,-0.03185860667996855,0,0,0.20708094341979558,-0.03185860667996855,0.015929303339984276,-0.03185860667996855,0,0,0.07964651669992137,-0.015929303339984276,0,-0.03185860667996855,0,0,0,0,0.03185860667996855,-0.07964651669992137,0,-0.015929303339984276,0.03185860667996855,0,0.03185860667996855,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-225-1","text":"> So I called this **genetics by composition rather than genetics by decomposition**.

Therefore you're entitled to say that because they have the same value, it is that they have the same… anything that's common in their sequence is therefore that which works. > > And you want to go far away, like fish and mouse, because **you want time to have corroded everything that is non-essential**. If you do things like mice to man, there hasn't been enough time. We contain mousy features simply because we came from something that also gave rise to mouse. But fish is so far away that effectively we've put enough noise into the rubbish to be able to say, this is the rubbish, this is junk. > > So that I think is a rigorous experimental approach to this and that's why I think **we will be actually doing the genetics of evolution** in the next few years. I think that this will be the way to do it.","section":225,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.1300764755932541,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,0,0,0.01858235365617916,-0.055747060968537474,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,0.03716470731235832,0,0.055747060968537474,0,0.11149412193707495,-0.03716470731235832,0,-0.07432941462471664,0.01858235365617916,0,0.01858235365617916,-0.01858235365617916,0.5017235487168373,0,0.055747060968537474,-0.03716470731235832,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0.3716470731235832,-0.055747060968537474,0.14865882924943327,0,0.03716470731235832,0,0,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,-0.055747060968537474,0,-0.01858235365617916,0.03716470731235832,0,0,0,0,-0.01858235365617916,0.03716470731235832,-0.01858235365617916,0,-0.07432941462471664,0,-0.01858235365617916,0.01858235365617916,-0.01858235365617916,0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,0.055747060968537474,0,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1300764755932541,0.01858235365617916,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0.03716470731235832,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,-0.01858235365617916,0.03716470731235832,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.055747060968537474,0,-0.03716470731235832,0,0,0.055747060968537474,-0.01858235365617916,0,-0.055747060968537474,0,-0.01858235365617916,0,-0.07432941462471664,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0,-0.2601529511865082,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03716470731235832,-0.0929117682808958,0,0,0,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11149412193707495,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0.01858235365617916,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0,-0.03716470731235832,0.03716470731235832,0,0.2601529511865082,0,0,-0.07432941462471664,0,0,0,0,0.03716470731235832,-0.01858235365617916,0.03716470731235832,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,-0.055747060968537474,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0,-0.07432941462471664,0.01858235365617916,-0.055747060968537474,0,-0.07432941462471664,0,0,0,-0.055747060968537474,0,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,-0.01858235365617916,0.01858235365617916,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0.01858235365617916,-0.01858235365617916,0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,0,-0.055747060968537474,0,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,-0.03716470731235832,0,-0.03716470731235832,0,-0.0929117682808958,0,0,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0.055747060968537474,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0.03716470731235832,-0.01858235365617916,0,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0.055747060968537474,0,0,0,0,-0.35306471946740403,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0,-0.03716470731235832,0,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01858235365617916,0.01858235365617916,0,0,-0.24157059753032906,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07432941462471664,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01858235365617916,-0.01858235365617916,0.01858235365617916,-0.055747060968537474,0,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0.03716470731235832,-0.01858235365617916,0.03716470731235832,0,0,0,0.03716470731235832,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01858235365617916,0.055747060968537474,0,0.01858235365617916,-0.03716470731235832,0.11149412193707495,0,0,0,0.14865882924943327,-0.01858235365617916,0,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0.03716470731235832,-0.01858235365617916,0,0,0,0,0.01858235365617916,0,0.01858235365617916,-0.0929117682808958,0,-0.03716470731235832,0,0,0.01858235365617916,-0.01858235365617916,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-226-1","text":">

Now, this is a subject that preoccupies a lot of people because of course everybody would like to be creative and everybody wants to know where can they get it from. I mean, you know, if you could get a packet of creativity and buy it somewhere, that would be the ideal thing. > > I don't… I think one of the things about creativity is **not to be afraid of saying the wrong thing**. I think that's terribly important. Too many people are brought up, especially in our culture, that everything should be rational, should be worked out, and that daring ideas, you know, shouldn't be uttered simply because they are most likely to be wrong the first… the first time around. And I think the other answer to creativity is that, I mean… **daydreaming is terribly important, but the essence of science is to bring it… to realise it, to implement it**. > > And I think one of the things about creativity is to absolutely know where and how one could actually prove this. Now, I know there's a lot spoken about Popper's approach to this, in which one should actually work out ways of… of disproving one's theory. Of course Popper I don't think is too… too cognisant of the psychology of scientists. He may know something about the philosophy of science, but you find me a scientist who's actually going to sit down and work a way out of disproving his results. Because most of us, realising the pernicketiness of nature and the unreliability of nature, have to work hard to prove our results. Because the first time an experiment is done it's likely not to work. Not because the theory is wrong, but just because the whole entropic universe is reaching us instantly we start to dabble in it. > > So I think it takes quite a lot of… **part of creativity is actually something which is a bit irrational, which is a feel that this is the right thing.** And that one will go to some lengths, actually, to realise it.","section":228,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.13949870537261422,0,0,0,0,0,0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0,0,0.01992838648180203,0,0.03985677296360406,-0.01992838648180203,0,0,0.03985677296360406,0,0,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0,0.41849611611784265,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0.3387825701906345,0,0.19928386481802032,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0,-0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01992838648180203,-0.01992838648180203,0.01992838648180203,0,0,-0.03985677296360406,0,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0.09964193240901016,0,0,-0.05978515944540609,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0.01992838648180203,0,0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0.01992838648180203,-0.01992838648180203,0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11957031889081218,0.01992838648180203,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0.07971354592720813,0,0.05978515944540609,0,0,0,0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11957031889081218,0,0,0,0,0.01992838648180203,-0.05978515944540609,0,0,0,0,0.01992838648180203,-0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07971354592720813,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03985677296360406,0,-0.01992838648180203,0.07971354592720813,-0.01992838648180203,0,-0.05978515944540609,0.03985677296360406,-0.05978515944540609,0.01992838648180203,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05978515944540609,0,0.05978515944540609,0,0.01992838648180203,-0.01992838648180203,0,-0.03985677296360406,0,-0.01992838648180203,0,0,0.11957031889081218,0,0.15942709185441625,0,0,0,0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0.03985677296360406,0,0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03985677296360406,0.03985677296360406,-0.03985677296360406,0,0,0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0,0,0.07971354592720813,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0,-0.03985677296360406,0.01992838648180203,-0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07971354592720813,0,0,0,-0.11957031889081218,0,-0.01992838648180203,0,-0.09964193240901016,0,-0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0,0,0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03985677296360406,0,-0.01992838648180203,0,-0.05978515944540609,0.05978515944540609,0,0,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0,0,0.01992838648180203,-0.03985677296360406,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01992838648180203,0,0.03985677296360406,0,0.09964193240901016,0,0,-0.03985677296360406,0.03985677296360406,0,0.19928386481802032,0,0,0,0.01992838648180203,-0.27899741074522844,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03985677296360406,0.01992838648180203,0,0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0.03985677296360406,0,0,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0.05978515944540609,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0.03985677296360406,0,0,0,0.01992838648180203,0,0,-0.03985677296360406,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05978515944540609,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0,-0.13949870537261422,0.03985677296360406,0,0,0,0.07971354592720813,-0.03985677296360406,0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0,0,0.03985677296360406,0,0.07971354592720813,-0.03985677296360406,0,0,0.4982096620450508,0,0,-0.05978515944540609,0,0,0.03985677296360406,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0,0,0,0,0.01992838648180203,-0.05978515944540609,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01992838648180203,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-229-1","text":"> Now, I mean, I'm doing something now which is quite interesting because it's… it has involved **turning things upside down**. And I think turning things upside down is something that we are not encouraged to do by our culture. Our culture has now imposed upon us that we should start at point A and proceed by the… by logical steps to B, C and D. But, you know, it sometimes is useful to ask whether in fact the effect is actually the cause, if I can put it that way. And what would it be like if indeed what you think is the outcome is actually the cause of the predecessor, just putting it in a very general way. So I think **inversion is… is sometimes a very useful way of being able to see things from another point of view**. > > Of course, what people should realise is that this… it takes also some kind of iron censor within oneself, that is, **one should not fall in love with one's theories. They should be treated as mistresses to be discarded once the pleasure is over.** That is what I think is… is a very important thing, and it's one of the characteristics of science that you must be ruthless towards your loved ones. When they go ugly, kill them. Get rid of them. Too much of science is… is dominated by people who fall in… of course, it's a way of falling in love with yourself, basically, and are very reluctant to give it up. Even though everything is strained at… at the… the joint. > > I mean, I once invented a thing called **'Occam's broom'**, or 'Occam's brush', as we say, and that is **the hypothesis which has the fewest of things you sweep under the carpet to leave it consistent**. And I think that one cannot go on sweeping things up under the carpet, you know, once the carpet has got an altitude of about 10 feet. > > So I simply… I simply believe that it takes… it takes a kind of mixture of… I've always felt that **science makes completely contradictory demands on the people that work on it**. It asks you to be… to be highly imaginative, yet it asks you to put on blinkers and drive through brick walls if necessary to get to the answer. It asks you to be passionate about invention, but it also asks you to be ruthless and cut off your own hand if it comes to that. And I think there are very few people that can combine this kind of… these opposites into one person. And looking at my students I've often found that all the characteristics of the one half are in one student, and all the characteristics of the other half are in the other student. So there are brilliant people that can never accomplish anything. And there are people that have no ideas but do things. **And if only one could chimerise them — join them into one person — one would have a good scientist.** Perhaps that's why science has to operate as a group, as a social unit. > > So I think that… and I can only say that to me the way I do my thinking is to **bounce lots of balls in my head, bounce, bounce, bounce**. And if you go on bouncing you begin to notice that sometimes two are bouncing together. **Those I think are the connections we have to make**, and that means that you've just got to go on thinking about things, and if it were like this what would be the outcome, and that I think's a very important thing to do in biology.","section":229,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.11602524754899278,0,0.025783388344220618,-0.012891694172110309,0,-0.012891694172110309,0,0,0.051566776688441236,0,0,0,0.012891694172110309,-0.051566776688441236,0,-0.012891694172110309,0,0,0.012891694172110309,0,0.1418086358932134,-0.012891694172110309,0.012891694172110309,-0.051566776688441236,0.012891694172110309,0,0.012891694172110309,0,0.48988437854019173,0,0,-0.025783388344220618,0.012891694172110309,-0.07735016503266186,0.012891694172110309,0,0.30940066013064743,0,0.2578338834422062,0,0,-0.025783388344220618,0.012891694172110309,0,0,0,0,-0.03867508251633093,0,-0.012891694172110309,0,-0.025783388344220618,0.012891694172110309,-0.012891694172110309,0.012891694172110309,-0.012891694172110309,0,-0.03867508251633093,0.012891694172110309,0,0,-0.10313355337688247,0.03867508251633093,-0.012891694172110309,0.012891694172110309,0,0.012891694172110309,-0.03867508251633093,0.03867508251633093,0,0,-0.012891694172110309,0,0,0,-0.012891694172110309,0,-0.025783388344220618,0.012891694172110309,0,0.07735016503266186,-0.012891694172110309,0.051566776688441236,0,0.012891694172110309,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11602524754899278,0,0,0,-0.012891694172110309,0.03867508251633093,0,0.025783388344220618,-0.051566776688441236,0,0,0.012891694172110309,0,0,0,0,-0.025783388344220618,0.012891694172110309,0,0,-0.1289169417211031,0.012891694172110309,0,0,0,0.012891694172110309,-0.025783388344220618,0,-0.025783388344220618,0,-0.012891694172110309,0.012891694172110309,-0.051566776688441236,0,0,0.012891694172110309,-0.012891694172110309,0.025783388344220618,-0.051566776688441236,0,-0.012891694172110309,0.012891694172110309,0,0,0,0,-0.012891694172110309,0,0,0.03867508251633093,0,0,-0.051566776688441236,0,-0.03867508251633093,0.012891694172110309,-0.03867508251633093,0,-0.025783388344220618,0,0,0,0,0,-0.012891694172110309,0.012891694172110309,0,0.1289169417211031,0,0.06445847086055155,-0.051566776688441236,0,-0.025783388344220618,0,-0.025783388344220618,0,-0.012891694172110309,0,-0.012891694172110309,0.051566776688441236,-0.012891694172110309,0.3222923543027577,-0.025783388344220618,0.025783388344220618,0,0,0,0,-0.051566776688441236,0.09024185920477217,-0.012891694172110309,0.025783388344220618,0,0,0,0.012891694172110309,0,0,-0.06445847086055155,0.012891694172110309,-0.03867508251633093,0.03867508251633093,0,0,0,0.03867508251633093,-0.025783388344220618,0.012891694172110309,0,0.012891694172110309,0,0.012891694172110309,0,0,-0.11602524754899278,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012891694172110309,0,0.012891694172110309,-0.025783388344220618,0.012891694172110309,0,0.012891694172110309,-0.012891694172110309,0,-0.03867508251633093,0,-0.03867508251633093,0,0,0,0,0,-0.051566776688441236,0,0,0.012891694172110309,0,0,-0.012891694172110309,0,0,0.025783388344220618,0,0,-0.025783388344220618,0,-0.012891694172110309,0,-0.012891694172110309,0,-0.03867508251633093,0.012891694172110309,0,0.012891694172110309,-0.025783388344220618,0.012891694172110309,0,0,-0.025783388344220618,0,0,0,-0.012891694172110309,0.012891694172110309,0,0.09024185920477217,-0.012891694172110309,0.025783388344220618,0,0.051566776688441236,0,0,0,0,0,0.2578338834422062,-0.012891694172110309,0,0,0,-0.2578338834422062,0,0,0,-0.025783388344220618,0,0,0.012891694172110309,0,0,0,0.025783388344220618,0,0,-0.012891694172110309,0.012891694172110309,0,0,0,0.012891694172110309,-0.06445847086055155,0.07735016503266186,0,0,0,0,-0.09024185920477217,0,-0.012891694172110309,0,0,0.012891694172110309,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.025783388344220618,0,-0.012891694172110309,0,0,0.012891694172110309,-0.025783388344220618,0.03867508251633093,0,0.025783388344220618,0,0.012891694172110309,-0.012891694172110309,0,-0.051566776688441236,0,0,0,0,0,-0.051566776688441236,0.025783388344220618,0,0.03867508251633093,-0.012891694172110309,0,0,0.03867508251633093,-0.012891694172110309,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.025783388344220618,-0.012891694172110309,0.051566776688441236,-0.07735016503266186,0.07735016503266186,-0.012891694172110309,0.012891694172110309,0,0.2707255776143165,-0.025783388344220618,0,-0.025783388344220618,0,0,0.07735016503266186,-0.012891694172110309,0,-0.012891694172110309,0.012891694172110309,0,0,-0.012891694172110309,0.025783388344220618,-0.06445847086055155,0,-0.012891694172110309,0.025783388344220618,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-230-1","text":"> Well, you ask about the balance between ignorance and knowledge. Of course, I've said it's good to be ignorant and I've also said it's good to know, in fact, I do know a lot. I think **it is good to be ignorant about a new field and know a lot about the old ones, as you transit from the old to the new**. And maybe… so those things are not as contradictory as they may seem. > > Let me give you one example. I mean, two years ago I wrote a paper called *Encoded Combinatorial Chemistry*. This was a rather bizarre, and I think very important conceptually, and possibly a technological… technological invention, in which we apply genetic arguments and the… and actually give a mechanism of using it in… for inanimate material. And the question that is proposed there is how would you take just ordinary chemistry and be able to do natural selection on it? And of course you can't, if you say, natural selection depends on replication — I mean, glucose can't replicate itself. So that means that's out. So what you have to do is basically to have a lot of glucose and be able to extract more from it than you start with. And that's possible. > > Since the only thing you can replicate is DNA, then what you have to do is to have a gene for glucose. But of course we don't want to invent a gene that makes glucose, but now with technology we can actually synthesise a gene and we can say this gene stands for glucose. Right? So that means we simply have a table and we simply attach this gene to glucose, which is the way we put glucose into the same area, into the same physical environment as this gene — the way we link phenotype to genotype. But if you look at this... this is very… this is completely different to the standard genetic system, in which we actually define the genotype from the phenotype. > > Now, this means that with this genetic tag and with PCR [polymerase chain reaction] we can always amplify the tag. But if you think about it, the tag — because DNA is double-stranded — every time we amplify a tag we get both chains. Therefore one chain is always a specific way to enrich for glucose. Therefore formally in such systems you can realise Darwinian selection for systems that are purely chemical simply by reversing the information transfer, if you like, by the intervention of human discipline. > > Now, it's very lucky that I knew very little about chemistry, because when this proposition, which is theoretically correct, was shown to chemists it was turned down by people saying, you'll never be able to make these. That is, you know, you just argue out of ignorance, well, I'm sure there must be the various protecting groups that you can do. No, many people looked at this and said it's impossible to do. Now, I think they knew too much organic chemistry, and the fact that we persisted and do it depended on me **being completely, well, not completely ignorant, but ignorant enough about the field** to say, well, it is not beyond the wit of chemists to find this if they look hard enough. But of course, the original thinking there was nothing to do with organic chemistry, and it had to do with the… the logic of knowing a lot about genetics and knowing a lot about what the things really meant there. > > So that is what I think it's important, why I say it's important to be ignorant, because had I listened to the organic chemists that would never be a practical thing. So, since I've spent a lot of time in my life in going from one field to another I've always… always been in this **permanent transition between knowledge and ignorance**. So maybe I just find it a very natural way to proceed.","section":230,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.09796244778275266,0,0,0,0,0,0.04898122389137633,-0.024490611945688166,0.024490611945688166,-0.03673591791853225,0,0,0,-0.06122652986422041,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.03673591791853225,0.03673591791853225,0,0.17143428361981716,-0.03673591791853225,0.03673591791853225,-0.08571714180990858,0,0,0.012245305972844083,0,0.5632840747508278,0,0,-0.03673591791853225,0,-0.06122652986422041,0.024490611945688166,0,0.31837795529394614,-0.012245305972844083,0.2693967314025698,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.03673591791853225,0,-0.024490611945688166,0,0,0.012245305972844083,-0.024490611945688166,0.012245305972844083,0,0.024490611945688166,0,0,0,0.012245305972844083,0,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.024490611945688166,0,-0.03673591791853225,0.09796244778275266,0,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,0,0.012245305972844083,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11020775375559674,0,0,0,0.012245305972844083,0,0.024490611945688166,0,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.06122652986422041,0.012245305972844083,0,0,-0.03673591791853225,0.012245305972844083,-0.012245305972844083,0.04898122389137633,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012245305972844083,0,0,0,0,-0.03673591791853225,0.012245305972844083,0,0.012245305972844083,0,0,0,0,-0.024490611945688166,0,0,0.024490611945688166,-0.0734718358370645,0,0,0.012245305972844083,0,0.012245305972844083,-0.15918897764697307,0,0,0,-0.06122652986422041,0.012245305972844083,0,0.012245305972844083,-0.0734718358370645,0.012245305972844083,-0.012245305972844083,0.0734718358370645,0,0,-0.024490611945688166,0.06122652986422041,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.012245305972844083,0.06122652986422041,0,0,0,0.012245305972844083,0,0,0,0.09796244778275266,0,0,0,0.024490611945688166,-0.024490611945688166,0.024490611945688166,-0.03673591791853225,0,-0.024490611945688166,0.012245305972844083,-0.012245305972844083,0.0734718358370645,-0.012245305972844083,0.18367958959266123,0,0.024490611945688166,-0.012245305972844083,0,0,0,0,0.04898122389137633,-0.012245305972844083,0.012245305972844083,0,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,0,0.012245305972844083,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.012245305972844083,0.024490611945688166,0,0,0,0.0734718358370645,-0.012245305972844083,0,0,0.0734718358370645,0,0,0,0.012245305972844083,-0.024490611945688166,0,0,0,0,0.012245305972844083,0,0.012245305972844083,0,0.024490611945688166,-0.024490611945688166,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.03673591791853225,0,-0.04898122389137633,0.012245305972844083,-0.06122652986422041,0.024490611945688166,0,0,0,0,-0.09796244778275266,0,0,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.012245305972844083,0.012245305972844083,0,0,-0.012245305972844083,0.04898122389137633,0,0,-0.06122652986422041,0.024490611945688166,0,0,-0.024490611945688166,0,-0.03673591791853225,0.012245305972844083,0,0.012245305972844083,-0.03673591791853225,0.012245305972844083,-0.012245305972844083,0,0,0.012245305972844083,0,0.06122652986422041,-0.012245305972844083,0.024490611945688166,0,0.03673591791853225,0,0,-0.024490611945688166,0.012245305972844083,-0.03673591791853225,0.20817020153834942,-0.03673591791853225,0.012245305972844083,-0.04898122389137633,0,-0.2204155075111935,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,0,0.0734718358370645,-0.024490611945688166,0,0,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012245305972844083,-0.15918897764697307,0.012245305972844083,0,0,0,0.012245305972844083,-0.06122652986422041,0,0,0,0,0.03673591791853225,0,0.012245305972844083,0,0,0,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.024490611945688166,0,0,0.012245305972844083,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.0734718358370645,0,-0.11020775375559674,0.012245305972844083,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012245305972844083,-0.012245305972844083,0.024490611945688166,0,0.012245305972844083,0,0.09796244778275266,0,0.03673591791853225,0,0,0,0,0,0.0734718358370645,0,0.03673591791853225,-0.012245305972844083,0.12245305972844082,-0.04898122389137633,0,-0.03673591791853225,0.18367958959266123,-0.08571714180990858,0,-0.03673591791853225,0.012245305972844083,0,0.024490611945688166,-0.024490611945688166,0.012245305972844083,0,0,-0.012245305972844083,0,-0.012245305972844083,0.024490611945688166,-0.06122652986422041,0,0,0.024490611945688166,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-231-1","text":"> Well, I think the… I mean, the thing that I think is the most… well, I've had many different kinds of achievement.

Unfortunately many of my colleagues thought that we should get young people, but they should work for them, and I'm afraid that I did… I made many appointments during my time but I did not succeed in convincing the structure and so whereas I had hoped to leave an entire new generation of many outstanding young scientists, that did not happen. > > So I don't think I was a lousy director in that sense, but I think I failed in achieving something which I would have thought is the right thing, and it just hasn't been achieved and I think that'll be to the detriment. However, I did go off and start another lab where we have some young people and so, therefore, you know, we'll just continue business under another name.","section":232,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.02252600791533647,0,0,0,0.011263003957668235,-0.02252600791533647,0.011263003957668235,0,0.033789011873004704,0,0,0,0.05631501978834118,-0.02252600791533647,0.02252600791533647,-0.02252600791533647,0,0,0.10136703561901411,0,0.09010403166134588,0,0,-0.09010403166134588,0,-0.02252600791533647,0,-0.011263003957668235,0.5068351780950706,0,0,-0.033789011873004704,0,0,0,0,0.24778608706870117,-0.033789011873004704,0.40546814247605645,-0.011263003957668235,0.011263003957668235,0,0,-0.02252600791533647,0.011263003957668235,0,0.02252600791533647,-0.04505201583067294,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02252600791533647,0,-0.033789011873004704,0,-0.02252600791533647,0,-0.011263003957668235,0.09010403166134588,-0.05631501978834118,0.011263003957668235,-0.011263003957668235,0,-0.011263003957668235,0.02252600791533647,0,0.02252600791533647,-0.011263003957668235,0,0,0.011263003957668235,-0.011263003957668235,0.011263003957668235,-0.02252600791533647,0,0,0.011263003957668235,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02252600791533647,0,0,-0.16894505936502352,0.033789011873004704,0,0,-0.04505201583067294,0.04505201583067294,-0.02252600791533647,0.011263003957668235,-0.033789011873004704,0,0,0.033789011873004704,0,0,-0.011263003957668235,0.011263003957668235,0,0,0,0.011263003957668235,-0.04505201583067294,0,0,0.02252600791533647,0,0.06757802374600941,-0.02252600791533647,0.02252600791533647,-0.02252600791533647,0,0,0.011263003957668235,-0.11263003957668236,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06757802374600941,0.011263003957668235,0,0,0,0,0,0.04505201583067294,-0.033789011873004704,0,-0.011263003957668235,0.07884102770367765,-0.02252600791533647,0,-0.05631501978834118,0.07884102770367765,-0.011263003957668235,0.011263003957668235,-0.05631501978834118,0.011263003957668235,-0.011263003957668235,0,-0.011263003957668235,0.011263003957668235,0,0,0,0,-0.011263003957668235,0.12389304353435059,0,0,-0.02252600791533647,0.05631501978834118,-0.011263003957668235,0,-0.011263003957668235,0,0,0,-0.011263003957668235,0.033789011873004704,0,0.3604161266453835,0,0,0,0,-0.04505201583067294,0,0,0.04505201583067294,0,0.011263003957668235,-0.011263003957668235,0,-0.011263003957668235,0,0,0.011263003957668235,-0.05631501978834118,0.033789011873004704,-0.011263003957668235,0.011263003957668235,0,0.02252600791533647,-0.07884102770367765,0.04505201583067294,-0.011263003957668235,0.011263003957668235,-0.011263003957668235,0,0,0.011263003957668235,0,0,-0.011263003957668235,0,-0.033789011873004704,0,0,0,-0.033789011873004704,0,-0.02252600791533647,0,-0.04505201583067294,0.011263003957668235,0,0,-0.011263003957668235,0.011263003957668235,-0.011263003957668235,0,-0.04505201583067294,0,0,0,-0.011263003957668235,0.02252600791533647,-0.02252600791533647,0.011263003957668235,0,0,0,0,-0.02252600791533647,0.011263003957668235,-0.02252600791533647,0,0,0.011263003957668235,-0.02252600791533647,0.06757802374600941,0,0.011263003957668235,-0.011263003957668235,0.02252600791533647,0,0.011263003957668235,0,0.011263003957668235,0,0.02252600791533647,0,0,-0.033789011873004704,0,0,0,0,0.011263003957668235,-0.011263003957668235,0,-0.011263003957668235,0,0,0.07884102770367765,0,0,-0.011263003957668235,0.05631501978834118,0,0.1576820554073553,-0.011263003957668235,0,-0.011263003957668235,0.011263003957668235,-0.14641905144968706,0,0,0,-0.033789011873004704,0,0,0,0,0.011263003957668235,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02252600791533647,0,0,-0.09010403166134588,0.033789011873004704,0,0,0,0,-0.10136703561901411,0,0,0.02252600791533647,-0.011263003957668235,0.011263003957668235,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05631501978834118,0.011263003957668235,-0.011263003957668235,0.02252600791533647,0,0.02252600791533647,0,0,-0.02252600791533647,0.011263003957668235,0,0,0,0.011263003957668235,0,0.02252600791533647,0,0,0,0,0,0.05631501978834118,0,0,0,0,-0.011263003957668235,0,0,0.04505201583067294,0,0.05631501978834118,-0.02252600791533647,0.05631501978834118,-0.02252600791533647,0,0,0.27031209498403763,-0.033789011873004704,0,-0.06757802374600941,0.02252600791533647,0,0.06757802374600941,0,0,-0.011263003957668235,0,0,0,-0.011263003957668235,0.011263003957668235,-0.07884102770367765,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-233-1","text":"> Well, you asked to see how the subject will be in 30 years' time. I think that the two things that will happen is… the **three things that will happen** will be the following. I think **evolution will become an experimental subject** which will be wonderful. I think with that sort of knowledge we will even start to make new animals, perhaps… I once gave a lecture on how to make a centaur by means other than transplantation surgery — which is the way the Greeks made centaurs — and what you would have to know in terms of developmental biology to create a six-limbed vertebrate, because that's what centaurs are. > > But I think we will move on towards, I think, **synthetic biology**. I think also that in terms of… so I think evolution is going to be the subject over the next 25 years. I think there are going to be amazing discoveries that are going to tell us quite a lot about the past, and I think we're actually going to recapitulate the past. And that, I think, will be the most exciting thing, and I think it will bring a new kind of synthetic approach to the subject, which is now just being carved into smaller and smaller pieces. > > I think that in terms of the understanding of… I think the big subject that will develop, the subject that will have to be reinvented, is **physiology**. So that is, nobody knows how to connect up all these molecular events to the actual functioning of an organism, or an organ system, so I think physiology will have to be reinvented so that we can grasp how all this molecular stuff is embedded in the function of an organism. > > And, of course, **the physiology that'll be the most interesting will be the physiology of the brain**. There's a tremendous discussion now on neurobiology and its theory and what is consciousness and so on, and I think a lot of this discussion will just… all the… way people are talking about it will vanish, you see.

But the subject I think that's going to be very interesting, which the new biology will open up, is in fact the **understanding of ourselves as organisms**. I think for the first time we can **attack the fundamental biology of man** and I see even now the beginnings of trying to understand our evolution and our history and our culture and in terms of our biology as one thing, so I think the great dream of the human sciences will be realised in the near future because we can just… and if it is correct that the genome still retains evidence of past history, we should be able to recreate history beyond the written word and integrate it with this, so I think there will be more of that science.","section":233,"source":"transcript","embedding":[0.20933372728814914,0,0,0,0,-0.026166715911018643,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.026166715911018643,0,-0.026166715911018643,0,0,0,0,0.026166715911018643,-0.013083357955509321,0,-0.10466686364407457,0.013083357955509321,-0.026166715911018643,0.026166715911018643,0,0.5887511079979194,-0.039250073866527964,0.039250073866527964,-0.013083357955509321,0.013083357955509321,-0.013083357955509321,0,0,0.27475051706569575,-0.039250073866527964,0.2485838011546771,0,0,-0.013083357955509321,0,0,0.052333431822037285,-0.013083357955509321,0,-0.026166715911018643,0,-0.026166715911018643,0,-0.013083357955509321,0.026166715911018643,0,0,0,0,-0.06541678977754661,0,0,0,-0.039250073866527964,0.026166715911018643,-0.013083357955509321,0.013083357955509321,-0.039250073866527964,0.013083357955509321,-0.013083357955509321,0.026166715911018643,0,0,-0.013083357955509321,0,-0.013083357955509321,0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,0,0,0.052333431822037285,-0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.27475051706569575,0,0,0.013083357955509321,-0.06541678977754661,0.013083357955509321,-0.026166715911018643,0.06541678977754661,0,0,0,0.052333431822037285,0,0.013083357955509321,0,0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,0.013083357955509321,-0.039250073866527964,0,0,0,-0.026166715911018643,0.013083357955509321,-0.013083357955509321,0.013083357955509321,0,0.013083357955509321,-0.013083357955509321,0.039250073866527964,-0.052333431822037285,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06541678977754661,0,0,0.013083357955509321,0,0.013083357955509321,0,0.013083357955509321,-0.013083357955509321,0,-0.013083357955509321,0.039250073866527964,-0.2485838011546771,0,-0.039250073866527964,0.013083357955509321,-0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,0,0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,0,-0.013083357955509321,0.013083357955509321,0,0.10466686364407457,0,0,-0.013083357955509321,0.013083357955509321,-0.026166715911018643,0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,0,-0.013083357955509321,0.026166715911018643,-0.013083357955509321,0.2485838011546771,0,0,0,0,-0.013083357955509321,0,0,0.026166715911018643,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.026166715911018643,0,-0.026166715911018643,0,0,0.039250073866527964,0,0.013083357955509321,-0.026166715911018643,0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,0.026166715911018643,-0.013083357955509321,0.013083357955509321,0,0,-0.052333431822037285,0,-0.09158350568856524,0,-0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,0,0,-0.026166715911018643,0,0,0,-0.026166715911018643,0,-0.052333431822037285,0,-0.06541678977754661,0,0,0,0,0.013083357955509321,-0.039250073866527964,0,0,0,0,0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,0,-0.013083357955509321,0,-0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.026166715911018643,0,0,0,0.013083357955509321,-0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,-0.013083357955509321,0,0,0.026166715911018643,0,0.013083357955509321,-0.013083357955509321,0.039250073866527964,-0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,-0.14391693751060253,0,0,0.052333431822037285,-0.039250073866527964,0,-0.013083357955509321,0,-0.15700029546611186,0,-0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,0,0.013083357955509321,-0.013083357955509321,0.013083357955509321,0,0.026166715911018643,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.026166715911018643,0,-0.13083357955509323,0.013083357955509321,-0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,-0.039250073866527964,0,0,0.039250073866527964,0,0,0,0.026166715911018643,0,0,-0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,0,0,-0.013083357955509321,0.013083357955509321,-0.026166715911018643,0,0,0.039250073866527964,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.013083357955509321,0,0,0.026166715911018643,-0.039250073866527964,0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,0,0,0.026166715911018643,-0.026166715911018643,0.013083357955509321,0,0,0,0,0,0.013083357955509321,0,0.013083357955509321,0,0.052333431822037285,-0.013083357955509321,0,0,0.26166715911018645,-0.039250073866527964,0,-0.013083357955509321,0,-0.026166715911018643,0.026166715911018643,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.052333431822037285,0,0,0,0,0.052333431822037285,-0.013083357955509321,0,0]},{"id":"transcript-234-1","text":"> And of course, I… I believe that… I think **the profession of science will change markedly over the next 25 years** because I don't think it can last as it… in its present structure. Now, the present structure wants… the present structure is assumed on infinite growth. In other words, every student expects to be a post-doc, every post-doc expects to be an assistant professor with five students. Every assistant professor expects to be an associate professor with eight post-docs and five students and so on and so forth and **that can't last** and I… and I think the industrial structure will have to change. > > And what I think will happen in the future is that, I think, **people will do research for only part of their lives** and I think research — with very few exceptions — is really the job for young people, largely because as I've said they contain the required ignorance that is necessary for this, and I think it would be perfectly reasonable for people to do research for 5 years or 8 years of their lives and then go on to do other things, like be doctors or be farmers or something else in society. > > But I think the profession of the professional scientist with a career structure will change, because I think it may well be that doing biology will become like the old days of doing natural history but with molecular tools, and I think we have to have some solution of that if we are to… if we are to simply maintain the advance, because all of history shows that notwithstanding the great growth and professionalisation of science **the number of important sciences has remained constant, roughly speaking, since the 17th century**. > > So, the point is… is that as long as those people gravitate to the subject that'll be fine. For the rest of it, as I've always said, we should always decide, I mean, **why is it necessary to solve all problems in this generation?** There are things we should leave to our successors and it seems to me there are lots of problems — I could write them all down — in which it wouldn't matter if they were solved 30 years in the future. I mean there… there are clearly problems that we need to solve now, but lots of them could wait and that's what I think we… we would do. > > And the last thing, I think, is that I think **DNA will come to occupy the centre of biology** as it has in the past. And I wanted very much to have… because I think man will destroy everything living on this planet, I would like to preserve everything in the form of DNA. And what I wanted was… and I created these words very carefully, because before the recession I thought I could interest the Japanese in funding this but I'm afraid this isn't the case now; which is to have **a DNA treasure house**. I like the word 'treasure house', not 'museum', and the idea would be this: is collect the DNA of every living species and just store it. I mean, ultimately we could certainly sequence it and find out what it is long after it's gone, so why trust to this terrible risk of... of survival of DNA in the form of a fossil when we could deliberately fossilise it, and then who knows, in 20 years' time, 50 years' time **we could have our own Jurassic Park**, except we wouldn't be as stupid as they were the way they do it and we could recreate these organisms. > > So I think that may well be the sort of thing, and organisms will be characterised on their DNA.

experiments where the signal is so large you don’t need fragile statistics (“seven‑cycle log paper… if you can see a difference it’s significant”). (§62) - Prefer domains where outcomes are effectively Boolean (“genetics is digital; it’s all or none… you can do yes/no”). (§62) - Prefer representations that *reduce dimensionality* (3D reality → 1D information) because they make search, mapping, and “what must be true next” tractable.

(§198) - Prefer “opening game” positions where even crude experiments update you massively and competition doesn’t dominate your attention.

(§62) - **Representation change:** rewriting the problem so hypotheses separate (coordinate change). - **Dimensional reduction:** compressing a problem into a lower‑dimensional representation (especially 3D → 1D information). (§58) - **Materialize:** compile a theory into a concrete test (“how would you go about doing anything about it?”). (§66, §42) - **Inversion:** deliberate flipping of viewpoint/causal direction to reveal new constraints. (§229) - **Machine language (of the object):** the system’s executable primitives (neurons/cells/genes), not a descriptive fit. (§147, §208) - **Information vs implementation (Schrödinger’s error):** the program specifies and describes the means, but does not itself contain the executing machinery; the program must build the machinery. (§45–§46) - **Chastity vs impotence:** “won’t” vs “can’t” — outcome‑equivalent but mechanistically different; basis of potency checks. (§50) - **Don’t Worry hypothesis:** proceed with a coherent framework while treating missing mechanisms as latent placeholders. (§57) - **Occam’s broom:** the hypothesis that sweeps the fewest inconvenient facts under the carpet; monitor the carpet height. (§106, §229) - **Exception quarantine:** keep the coherent core, isolate anomalies explicitly, resolve later. (§110–§111) - **Imprisoned imagination:** stay inside physical scale/constraints so you don’t build impossible cartoons. (§66) - **Productive ignorance:** resisting entrainment so “can’t work” doesn’t become an untested dogma. (§63, §192) - **Junk vs garbage:** definitional separation between neutral “rubbish you keep” and deleterious “rubbish you throw out,” used to prioritize what deserves attention. (§175) - **System:** a reusable experimental platform/assay that compounds downstream progress (“you had a system”). (§60) - **Opening game / out of phase:** strategic positioning for high freedom and high information gain. (§143, §192) - **Open the box / grammar of the system:** explanations must include intermediate construction rules; I/O behavior alone is underdetermined. (§117) - **Phase problem:** missing-variable ambiguity that makes inference combinatorially intractable (2^N); requires a phase-breaking trick. (§88–§89) - **Mutational spectra:** use induction/reversion patterns as a classifier of mechanism classes (a typing instrument, not just “more mutants”). (§90) - **Genetic dissection:** use conditional lethals / switches to localize essential function. (§123) - **Hierarchical self-assembly:** treat complex structures as staged assembly; test by reconstitution and sub-assembly perturbations. (§124) - **Lineage vs neighborhood computation:** alternate coordinate systems for development (history vs spatial context). (§161) - **Lineage vs gradients:** analogue vs digital development coordinate choice. (§205) - **Genetic surgery:** mutation-first proof of function; you can’t assert “wild-type gene” without mutants. (§215) - **Inside-out genetics:** tooling-mediated reversal (gene → phenotype) that removes life-cycle bottlenecks.

xt":"9) What’s still missing (next extraction steps) This doc is a unified *map*, not yet a fully operational playbook. The next layer to build inside this repo would be: 1. A transcript‑grounded **quote bank** keyed to each operator (⊘/𝓛/⧉/≡/✂/⟂/↑/⇓/ΔE/∿/⊙). A seed exists as `quote_bank_restored_primitives.md`, but it still needs operator‑level normalization and coverage expansion. 2.

Sequencing *Fugu* yields the same \"source code\" at an 87.5% discount.","source":"distillation","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,-0.07106690545187015,0,-0.07106690545187015,0,0,0.07106690545187015,0,0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.7106690545187015,0,0.1421338109037403,0,0,0,0,0,0.21320071635561044,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1421338109037403,0,0,-0.21320071635561044,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.21320071635561044,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1421338109037403,0,0,0,0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,0.1421338109037403,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1421338109037403,0,0,0,0,0,0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1421338109037403,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1421338109037403,0.07106690545187015,-0.07106690545187015,0,0,0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1421338109037403,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0.07106690545187015,0,0,-0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1421338109037403,-0.07106690545187015,0.07106690545187015,0,0.07106690545187015,-0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07106690545187015,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07106690545187015,0,-0.07106690545187015,0,-0.07106690545187015,0,-0.07106690545187015,0,-0.07106690545187015,0.07106690545187015,0,0,-0.07106690545187015,0,0]},{"id":"distillation-gemini-8","text":"2.3.

It instantly filters out 99% of \"impossible cartoons\" that ignore diffusion rates, packing limits, or molecular counts. ---","source":"distillation","embedding":[0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,-0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.30000000000000004,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,-0.1,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1,0.1,0,0.2,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2,0,0,0,0,-0.30000000000000004,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,-0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.2,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0]},{"id":"distillation-gemini-19","text":"6.0.

The Brenner Instruction Set To run the \"Brenner Bot,\" execute the following: 1. **Digitize:** Force continuous biology into discrete, 1D integer problems. 2. **Invert:** Don't study the organism you have; design the organism you need. 3. **Encapsulate:** Modularize the unknown (\"Don't Worry\") to debug the known. 4. **Compress:** Prefer \"House of Cards\" theories that explain maximum data with minimum parameters. 5. **Quarantine:** Isolate anomalies explicitly (appendix) and monitor what you’re sweeping (Occam’s Broom). 6. **Pilot:** Run a cheap “quickie” to de-risk the hard experiment. 7. **Build:** Don’t wait for tools; build the crude version that tests the core logic (and change dominant physical variables by orders of magnitude when stuck). 8. **Exit:** Abandon success to optimize for novelty.","source":"distillation","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0.7592566023652966,0,0,0,0.05423261445466404,-0.10846522890932808,0,-0.10846522890932808,0.21693045781865616,-0.05423261445466404,0.10846522890932808,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0.10846522890932808,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0.05423261445466404,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0.16269784336399212,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0.10846522890932808,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.10846522890932808,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.10846522890932808,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05423261445466404,-0.05423261445466404,0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0.05423261445466404,-0.05423261445466404,0.05423261445466404,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.16269784336399212,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.10846522890932808,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0.10846522890932808,0,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,-0.10846522890932808,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0.05423261445466404,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0.10846522890932808,-0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0.05423261445466404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"distillation-opus-1","text":"Preamble: What This Document Attempts This is not a summary of Sydney Brenner's scientific contributions. It is an attempt to **reverse-engineer the cognitive architecture** that generated those contributions—to find the generative grammar of his thinking, so that it might be learned and applied. The method that emerges is not a list of tips. It is a **coherent epistemological framework** where each element implies the others. Miss the deep structure, and you have a collection of heuristics. Grasp it, and you have a way of seeing. --- # PART I: THE GENERATIVE CORE","source":"distillation","embedding":[0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06509445549041194,0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0.5207556439232955,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13018891098082389,0,0.19528336647123584,-0.13018891098082389,0.13018891098082389,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0.13018891098082389,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.13018891098082389,0,0,0.06509445549041194,0,0,-0.19528336647123584,0,0,0,-0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06509445549041194,0,-0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06509445549041194,0,0.19528336647123584,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0.06509445549041194,0,0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0.06509445549041194,-0.13018891098082389,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13018891098082389,0,0,0,0,0,0.3254722774520597,0,0,0,0.06509445549041194,-0.26037782196164777,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06509445549041194,-0.06509445549041194,0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06509445549041194,0,-0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06509445549041194,0,0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06509445549041194,0,0,0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0.06509445549041194,-0.06509445549041194,0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0.3905667329424717,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06509445549041194,0,0,0.06509445549041194,-0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,-0.06509445549041194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06509445549041194,0]},{"id":"distillation-opus-2","text":"The Two Axioms Everything in Brenner's method derives from two fundamental commitments.

And every explanation must be expressible in that language. ---","source":"distillation","embedding":[0.18525225632833153,0,0,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06175075210944384,0,0,0,0.03087537605472192,-0.12350150421888768,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5866321450397165,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,-0.09262612816416577,0.4322552647661069,-0.03087537605472192,0.1543768802736096,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06175075210944384,0,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12350150421888768,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06175075210944384,0,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,-0.12350150421888768,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09262612816416577,0,0,0,0,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0.21612763238305344,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03087537605472192,-0.06175075210944384,0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06175075210944384,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.09262612816416577,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0.06175075210944384,0,0.03087537605472192,-0.06175075210944384,0,0,0,-0.06175075210944384,0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,-0.06175075210944384,0,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0.06175075210944384,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0.12350150421888768,0,0,-0.12350150421888768,0.03087537605472192,0,0.06175075210944384,0,0,0,0,-0.24700300843777537,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06175075210944384,0,0,-0.06175075210944384,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0.09262612816416577,-0.09262612816416577,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,-0.06175075210944384,0.06175075210944384,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,-0.06175075210944384,0.03087537605472192,0,0.06175075210944384,0,0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0.18525225632833153,-0.03087537605472192,0.03087537605472192,0,0,-0.12350150421888768,0,0,0,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0,0,0.03087537605472192,-0.03087537605472192,0,0,0.12350150421888768,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"distillation-opus-5","text":"What Follows from the Axioms From these two commitments, the entire Brenner method unfolds with something like logical necessity:","source":"distillation","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.20851441405707477,0,0,0,0,0,0.41702882811414954,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.20851441405707477,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.20851441405707477,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.20851441405707477,0,0,0,0,0.20851441405707477,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.20851441405707477,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.20851441405707477,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.20851441405707477,0.20851441405707477,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.41702882811414954,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.20851441405707477,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.20851441405707477,0.20851441405707477,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.20851441405707477,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.20851441405707477,0,-0.20851441405707477,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"distillation-opus-6","text":"1.

Dimensional Reduction Makes Problems Tractable One of Brenner's most powerful moves was recognizing that DNA reduces biology from three dimensions to one: > \"Biology... had been three-dimensional, and a lot of people wanted it four-dimensional. But the whole idea that you could reduce it to one dimension is a very powerful idea... it makes the disentangling of everything so much easier to understand, makes copying easy to understand, makes expression easy to understand, makes the mapping easy to understand, and makes mutation easy to understand.\" This isn't just about DNA—it's a general principle. **Seek representations that reduce dimensionality.** One-dimensional sequences can be systematically searched. Mutations can be mapped. Recombination has a simple interpretation.

That is, you had to say, 'Well there could be a few new ribosomes made, they would have escaped your attention, but clearly these very few were capable of prodigious rates of function.'\" (§95) And the base composition paradox—the RNA of bacteria had invariant composition while their DNA varied enormously—pointed directly to the missing messenger.","source":"distillation","embedding":[0.1965892748731962,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14744195615489714,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5406205059012895,0,0,0,0,-0.04914731871829905,0.04914731871829905,0,0.29488391230979427,0,0.0982946374365981,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0982946374365981,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0982946374365981,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0982946374365981,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0982946374365981,0,0,0,-0.04914731871829905,0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0.0982946374365981,0,0,-0.14744195615489714,0,-0.0982946374365981,0,0,0.04914731871829905,-0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,-0.0982946374365981,0.04914731871829905,0,0.0982946374365981,0,0,0,0,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0.0982946374365981,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0.1965892748731962,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,-0.04914731871829905,0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,-0.04914731871829905,0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04914731871829905,0.04914731871829905,0,0.0982946374365981,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0.04914731871829905,-0.04914731871829905,0.0982946374365981,0,0.04914731871829905,-0.04914731871829905,0,-0.14744195615489714,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,-0.0982946374365981,0,0,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,-0.04914731871829905,0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04914731871829905,-0.04914731871829905,0.0982946374365981,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0982946374365981,0,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,-0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0,0,0,0,0.3931785497463924,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0,-0.1965892748731962,0,0,0.04914731871829905,0,0,0]},{"id":"distillation-opus-12","text":"7.

You get definitive answers from single experiments.","source":"distillation","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0.08355119862887136,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,0.12532679794330703,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.7101851883454066,0,0,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0,-0.04177559931443568,0.08355119862887136,0,0.16710239725774273,0,0.04177559931443568,-0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0.08355119862887136,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0.04177559931443568,-0.08355119862887136,0.08355119862887136,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,-0.12532679794330703,0.04177559931443568,0,0.08355119862887136,-0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08355119862887136,0,0,0,-0.08355119862887136,0,-0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08355119862887136,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,0.08355119862887136,0,0,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0.08355119862887136,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0.04177559931443568,-0.08355119862887136,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08355119862887136,0,0,0.04177559931443568,-0.08355119862887136,0.08355119862887136,0,0,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12532679794330703,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0.12532679794330703,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0.08355119862887136,0,0.16710239725774273,0,0,0,0,-0.25065359588661407,0,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,-0.12532679794330703,0.12532679794330703,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08355119862887136,0,0.08355119862887136,0,0.12532679794330703,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.08355119862887136,0,-0.04177559931443568,0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0.04177559931443568,-0.08355119862887136,0,0,0.08355119862887136,0,0,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12532679794330703,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04177559931443568,0,0,0,0,0,0.08355119862887136,0,0,-0.04177559931443568,0.08355119862887136,0]},{"id":"distillation-opus-17","text":"The DIY/Bricolage Approach Brenner repeatedly built things himself: - A Warburg manometer (to measure oxygen uptake) - An air turbine ultracentrifuge (to sediment particles inside cells) - A heliostat (for dark field microscopy) - Synthesized amino acids from human hair and milk - Made his own dyes for staining experiments > \"This is something you can always do... it's open to you.

grind.","source":"distillation","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11396057645963795,0,0,-0.11396057645963795,0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0.3418817293789138,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11396057645963795,-0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11396057645963795,0,-0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2279211529192759,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11396057645963795,0,0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2279211529192759,-0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2279211529192759,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11396057645963795,0,0,0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11396057645963795,0,0,0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,-0.3418817293789138,0,-0.2279211529192759,0,-0.2279211529192759,0,0,0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.2279211529192759,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,-0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,-0.2279211529192759,0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11396057645963795,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"distillation-opus-20","text":"HAL

I think you can always know too much... one of the things of being an experienced scientist in a subject is it curtails creativity, because you know too much and you know what won't work... I think what we should be doing is spreading ignorance rather than knowledge, because it's ignorance that allows you to do things.\" This isn't anti-intellectualism. It's a sophisticated insight about how expertise can become a prison. The expert knows all the reasons something \"can't work,\" which closes off exploratory paths. The outsider, unencumbered by this knowledge, can ask naive questions that turn out to be fundamental. **The Bayesian interpretation**: Experts have very tight priors concentrated on known solutions. Novices have diffuse priors that give non-zero probability to unconventional approaches. When the true solution lies outside the expert's probability mass, the novice has better expected outcomes. Brenner deliberately cultivated this through **cross-disciplinary movement**: from pigments to cytochemistry to microscopy to genetics to phage to coding problems. Each transition brought fresh eyes. He notes that Gamow could pose the coding problem \"in a form that no biochemists could pose it, because that's not the way they thought.\" > \"The best people to push a science forward are in fact those who come from outside it... **the émigrés are always the best people to make the new discoveries.**\" (§157) > \"John Sulston was an organic chemist by background.

This approach is 'very important in biology' because it permits productive theoretical work despite apparent difficulties.\" The DNA unwinding problem exemplifies this. When the double helix was proposed, many said unwinding looked \"impossible.\" Brenner's response: don't worry, assume an enzyme exists that can do it. This let theory proceed. Eventually helicases were discovered. **The deeper logic**: Science constantly faces problems of the form \"If X is true, then Y seems impossible.\" The Don't Worry hypothesis says: if X has strong evidence and Y only *seems* impossible (not proven impossible), assume Y has some solution and proceed with X. This is rational because: 1. \"Seems impossible\" is usually \"I can't currently imagine how\" 2. Nature has had billions of years to solve engineering problems 3. Blocking on Y wastes the inferential power of X He applied this to protein synthesis: \"Don't worry about the energy, energy will look after itself; the important thing is how do you get everything in the correct order?\" This strategic neglect of tractable-but-secondary problems focused attention on the genuinely hard question (the code).","source":"distillation","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03834824944236852,0,0.07669649888473704,-0.15339299776947407,0.03834824944236852,-0.07669649888473704,0,0,0,0,0.5752237416355278,0,0,0,0,-0.07669649888473704,0,0,0.11504474832710555,0,0.07669649888473704,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03834824944236852,0.11504474832710555,0,0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03834824944236852,-0.07669649888473704,0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,-0.03834824944236852,0,-0.03834824944236852,0,-0.03834824944236852,0,-0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07669649888473704,0.07669649888473704,0,0,-0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11504474832710555,0,0,0,0.03834824944236852,-0.03834824944236852,0,-0.07669649888473704,0,0,0.07669649888473704,0,0,0,0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,-0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0,0.07669649888473704,0,0,0,0.03834824944236852,0,0.03834824944236852,-0.2300894966542111,0,-0.11504474832710555,0,0,0,0,0.03834824944236852,-0.07669649888473704,0,0,0.03834824944236852,-0.03834824944236852,0,-0.03834824944236852,0,-0.03834824944236852,0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0.07669649888473704,0,0,0,0,-0.03834824944236852,0,0,0.07669649888473704,0,0.03834824944236852,0,0.03834824944236852,0,0.03834824944236852,-0.07669649888473704,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1917412472118426,0,0,0,0,0,0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.11504474832710555,0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0.07669649888473704,-0.07669649888473704,0,0,0,-0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07669649888473704,0.03834824944236852,-0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,-0.07669649888473704,0,-0.03834824944236852,0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07669649888473704,0,0,0,-0.03834824944236852,0,0,0.03834824944236852,0,0.03834824944236852,0,0,-0.07669649888473704,0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0.03834824944236852,-0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0,-0.15339299776947407,0.03834824944236852,-0.03834824944236852,0,0,0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0.07669649888473704,0,0.07669649888473704,0,0.07669649888473704,0,0,-0.07669649888473704,0.1917412472118426,0,0.07669649888473704,-0.03834824944236852,0,-0.03834824944236852,0,-0.1917412472118426,0,-0.03834824944236852,0,-0.03834824944236852,0,0,0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07669649888473704,0,0,0,0.03834824944236852,0,0,-0.07669649888473704,0,0,0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03834824944236852,0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,-0.03834824944236852,0.1917412472118426,0,0,-0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0.07669649888473704,0,0,-0.11504474832710555,0,-0.03834824944236852,0.1917412472118426,0,0.1917412472118426,-0.07669649888473704,0.07669649888473704,0,0,-0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03834824944236852,0.03834824944236852,-0.03834824944236852,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"distillation-opus-24","text":"The House of Cards Architecture Build theories where **all components mutually constrain each other**: > \"It was **the real house of cards theory**; you had to buy everything – that is, you couldn't take one fact and let it stand on itself and say the rest could go.

That was the dream.\nTakeaway: Use a *spectrum* (pattern over many mutants) to type causal mechanisms and constrain the code.\nTags: `spectra`, `typing`, `mechanism`, `recode`","section":90,"source":"quote","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05555555555555555,0,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1111111111111111,0,0,-0.05555555555555555,0,-0.05555555555555555,0,0,0.16666666666666666,-0.1111111111111111,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.16666666666666666,-0.05555555555555555,0.2222222222222222,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1111111111111111,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1111111111111111,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0.1111111111111111,-0.16666666666666666,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1111111111111111,-0.05555555555555555,0,-0.05555555555555555,0,-0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0.1111111111111111,0,0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,-0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0,0.2222222222222222,0,0,-0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1111111111111111,0,0.1111111111111111,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05555555555555555,0,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,-0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05555555555555555,0.2222222222222222,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,-0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0.1111111111111111,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,-0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.38888888888888884,0,-0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,-0.16666666666666666,0,0,0,-0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1111111111111111,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.16666666666666666,0,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0.1111111111111111,0,0,0,0.1111111111111111,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,0,0.1111111111111111,-0.05555555555555555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"quote-90","text":"none of these proflavine mutants could be induced to revert by base analogues and none of the base analogue mutants could be induced to revert by proflavine.\nTakeaway: Partition phenomena into equivalence classes by reversible transforms;

Three plusses cancel three minuses; therefore the reading unit is three.\nTags: `triplet-code`, `logic`, `genetics-as-instrument`, `proof`","section":109,"source":"quote","embedding":[0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,0.03760887072223008,0,0.07521774144446015,0,0,0,0.03760887072223008,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,0.03760887072223008,-0.03760887072223008,0.6393508022779113,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03760887072223008,0.11282661216669024,0,0.18804435361115038,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03760887072223008,-0.03760887072223008,0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07521774144446015,0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07521774144446015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0.03760887072223008,-0.07521774144446015,0,-0.11282661216669024,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18804435361115038,-0.07521774144446015,0,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07521774144446015,0,0,0.03760887072223008,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,-0.07521774144446015,0,0,0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0.03760887072223008,0,0.03760887072223008,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03760887072223008,0,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0.22565322433338048,0,0,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0.03760887072223008,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11282661216669024,-0.03760887072223008,0,-0.07521774144446015,0.07521774144446015,-0.1504354828889203,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03760887072223008,0.03760887072223008,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03760887072223008,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,-0.11282661216669024,0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.03760887072223008,0,0,-0.03760887072223008,0,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,-0.1504354828889203,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07521774144446015,0,0.03760887072223008,-0.03760887072223008,0.11282661216669024,0,0.03760887072223008,0,0,-0.03760887072223008,0.03760887072223008,0,0.11282661216669024,-0.11282661216669024,0,0,0.03760887072223008,-0.22565322433338048,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,-0.03760887072223008,0,-0.11282661216669024,0.03760887072223008,0,0,-0.03760887072223008,0.07521774144446015,0,0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07521774144446015,0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07521774144446015,0,0,0.11282661216669024,0,0,0,0,0,0.03760887072223008,0,0.07521774144446015,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0.3008709657778406,0,0,0,0.03760887072223008,-0.03760887072223008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07521774144446015,0,0,0,0,0.03760887072223008,0,0,0]},{"id":"quote-110","text":"And so when you get something like this, it tells you that **all the exceptions, each of which cannot be explained by the coherent theory... that the coherent theory remains, then.

This lets you study essential genes by turning them on and off at will.\nTags: `conditional-mutants`, `genetic-dissection`, `temperature-sensitive`, `tools`","section":123,"source":"quote","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07018624063435965,0,0.21055872190307895,0,0,0,0,0,0.1403724812687193,0,0,0,0,0,0.1403724812687193,-0.07018624063435965,0,0,0.07018624063435965,-0.07018624063435965,0,0,0.4211174438061579,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.21055872190307895,0,0.3509312031717982,0,0,-0.07018624063435965,0.07018624063435965,-0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1403724812687193,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1403724812687193,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0,0.1403724812687193,0,0.07018624063435965,-0.07018624063435965,0,0,0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0,0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07018624063435965,0,0.1403724812687193,-0.07018624063435965,0,0,0.07018624063435965,-0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1403724812687193,0,0.07018624063435965,0,0.1403724812687193,0,0,-0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,-0.07018624063435965,0,0,0.21055872190307895,0,0,0,0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0,-0.21055872190307895,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1403724812687193,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,-0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1403724812687193,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1403724812687193,0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1403724812687193,0,-0.07018624063435965,0,0,0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07018624063435965,-0.1403724812687193,0.1403724812687193,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07018624063435965,0,-0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,-0.1403724812687193,0.07018624063435965,0,0,-0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0.1403724812687193,0,0,0,0.1403724812687193,0,0,0,0,0,0.07018624063435965,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07018624063435965]},{"id":"quote-124","text":"It opened up the whole of the concept of how you make elaborate cell structures, and by this **hierarchical self-assembly mode**.\nTakeaway: Complex structures build themselves in stages.

The physicists who entered biology (Delbrück, Schrödinger, Crick) had to learn this the hard way.\nTags: `theory-vs-facts`, `specificity`, `empirical-grounding`","section":49,"source":"quote","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0.05277798139692595,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0.4222238511754076,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2111119255877038,0,0.15833394419077784,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0.15833394419077784,0,0.15833394419077784,0,0,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,-0.1055559627938519,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0.15833394419077784,-0.2638899069846298,0.1055559627938519,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0.1055559627938519,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.15833394419077784,0,0,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0.05277798139692595,-0.1055559627938519,0.05277798139692595,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,-0.1055559627938519,0.05277798139692595,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,-0.1055559627938519,0,0,0,-0.15833394419077784,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5805577953661855,0,0,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0.05277798139692595,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"quote-51","text":"This is something you can always do... it's open to you. **There's no magic in this** and I think the whole of the philosophy that says unless you've gone through this way, if you're an old chap of 25, you can't do it.

Conflating these causes confusion.\nTags: `development`, `function`, `levels`, `construction-paradigm`","section":132,"source":"quote","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.049875466805381644,0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09975093361076329,0,0.2493773340269082,0,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,-0.14962640041614494,0,0,0.5985056016645798,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.14962640041614494,0.14962640041614494,0,0.14962640041614494,-0.09975093361076329,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.14962640041614494,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.14962640041614494,0,0,0,-0.09975093361076329,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0.049875466805381644,0,0,-0.09975093361076329,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,0,0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19950186722152657,0,0,0,0.049875466805381644,-0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,-0.09975093361076329,0,-0.049875466805381644,0.2493773340269082,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.14962640041614494,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.09975093361076329,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0.049875466805381644,0,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,0,0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.049875466805381644,0,0.09975093361076329,0,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,-0.2992528008322899,0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0.049875466805381644,0,0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.049875466805381644,0.09975093361076329,0,0.049875466805381644,0,0.09975093361076329,0,0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14962640041614494,0,0,0,0.09975093361076329,0,0.09975093361076329,0,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,-0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.049875466805381644,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"quote-133","text":"They called all the students together and said, **'We want you to do pick and stab, because you have to test each plaque individually, and the first one who finds the mutant we will call this after his mother'**...

So evolution might actually be viewed as, you know, **one step backwards, two steps forward in another direction**.\nTakeaway: Evolution doesn't start from scratch. It builds rough structures then refines them. The genome contains both \"build a leg\" routines and \"refine the leg\" patches. This two-level architecture explains why mutants often \"make the same mess.\"\nTags: `evolution`, `programs`, `refinement`, `development`","section":171,"source":"quote","embedding":[0.21081851067789195,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0.31622776601683794,0,0.21081851067789195,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0.05270462766947299,-0.31622776601683794,0.05270462766947299,0,0.21081851067789195,0,0,0,0,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.31622776601683794,0,-0.10540925533894598,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0.05270462766947299,-0.10540925533894598,0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0.10540925533894598,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,-0.15811388300841897,0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0,-0.26352313834736496,0,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,-0.15811388300841897,0,-0.05270462766947299,0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0.10540925533894598,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.10540925533894598,0.05270462766947299,0,0.15811388300841897,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.15811388300841897,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.10540925533894598,0,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.10540925533894598,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0.10540925533894598,-0.15811388300841897,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.15811388300841897,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0.10540925533894598,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.15811388300841897,0,0,0.10540925533894598,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0.21081851067789195,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05270462766947299,0.10540925533894598,0,0.05270462766947299,-0.05270462766947299,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05270462766947299]},{"id":"quote-172","text":"Apart from looking at the structural changes we could analyse these mutants by putting them in combinations, the so-called **analysis of epistasis**.

This insight frames noncoding DNA correctly: not functional, not actively removed, just accumulated.\nTags: `junk-DNA`, `evolution`, `definitions`, `selection`","section":175,"source":"quote","embedding":[0.09428090415820634,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04714045207910317,0.04714045207910317,0,0,-0.09428090415820634,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0,-0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0.3299831645537222,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0.04714045207910317,-0.04714045207910317,0,0,0.37712361663282534,0,0.1414213562373095,-0.04714045207910317,0,-0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,-0.1414213562373095,0,0,0.23570226039551584,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,-0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,-0.09428090415820634,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04714045207910317,0,-0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,-0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0,-0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0.1414213562373095,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0.09428090415820634,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,-0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.18856180831641267,0,-0.09428090415820634,0,-0.282842712474619,0,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0.1414213562373095,-0.37712361663282534,0,0,0,0,0.23570226039551584,0,0,0,0.04714045207910317,-0.282842712474619,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04714045207910317,0,0,0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23570226039551584,0,0,-0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04714045207910317,0.04714045207910317,0,0,-0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04714045207910317,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.09428090415820634,0,0,0.09428090415820634,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"quote-176","text":"Having got to this stage... extensive analysis of the genetics of this beast, an extensive amount of work on the biochemistry beginning, the anatomy going ahead, the development going ahead... **one felt the ship was, was at sea but it was very unclear where it was heading**.\nTakeaway: Strategic uncertainty is normal.

Understanding this prevents forcing digital metaphors onto continuous processes.\nTags: `analogue`, `digital`, `Turing`, `computation`","section":197,"source":"quote","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.3634218921558155,0,0,0,0,-0.103834826330233,0,0,0.0519174131651165,0,0.3634218921558155,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0.0519174131651165,-0.2595870658255825,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.103834826330233,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0.207669652660466,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0.103834826330233,-0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.103834826330233,0,-0.103834826330233,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0.0519174131651165,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0,-0.103834826330233,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0519174131651165,-0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,0,0.207669652660466,0,0.103834826330233,0,0.103834826330233,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1557522394953495,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0.0519174131651165,-0.0519174131651165,0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0.0519174131651165,0,0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,-0.103834826330233,0,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,0,0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0.1557522394953495,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,-0.207669652660466,0,0,0,-0.1557522394953495,0,0,0,0,0.103834826330233,0,0.0519174131651165,0,0.103834826330233,0,0.103834826330233,0,0,0,0.0519174131651165,-0.0519174131651165,0.1557522394953495,-0.0519174131651165,0.0519174131651165,0,0.0519174131651165,-0.103834826330233,0,0,0,0,0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.103834826330233,0,0,0,0.103834826330233,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,0,0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2595870658255825,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.103834826330233,0,0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.207669652660466,-0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,-0.0519174131651165,0,0,0,0,0.1557522394953495,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"quote-198","text":"One of the things that we did and which ran through all of our work...

Comparative genomics is evolution's grant report.\nTags: `evolution`, `comparative`, `fish`, `experiment`","section":223,"source":"quote","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,-0.09901475429766744,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0.4950737714883372,0,0.14852213144650117,0,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0.29704426289300234,0,0.2475368857441686,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14852213144650117,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0.09901475429766744,0,0,0,0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0.09901475429766744,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09901475429766744,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0.04950737714883372,-0.04950737714883372,0.04950737714883372,0,0.04950737714883372,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0.14852213144650117,-0.09901475429766744,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0.09901475429766744,0,0.09901475429766744,-0.09901475429766744,0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09901475429766744,0,0.04950737714883372,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0.04950737714883372,0,0.09901475429766744,-0.09901475429766744,0,-0.19802950859533489,0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0.09901475429766744,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,-0.09901475429766744,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.19802950859533489,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,-0.09901475429766744,0.04950737714883372,-0.04950737714883372,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04950737714883372,0,0.04950737714883372,0,0.04950737714883372,0,0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,0.19802950859533489,-0.04950737714883372,0.04950737714883372,0,0.04950737714883372,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,-0.14852213144650117,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.19802950859533489,0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04950737714883372,-0.09901475429766744,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09901475429766744,0,0,0,0,0,0.14852213144650117,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04950737714883372,0,-0.09901475429766744,0,0,0,0,0,-0.19802950859533489,0,-0.04950737714883372,0.09901475429766744,0,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"quote-225","text":"So I called this **genetics by composition rather than genetics by decomposition**.

Major outcomes hinge on trivial causes.\nTags: `contingency`, `luck`, `history`, `origins`","section":1,"source":"quote","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06551217820804184,0,0,0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,0,0.19653653462412551,0,0,0,0,-0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,0.19653653462412551,0,0,0,0,-0.06551217820804184,0.06551217820804184,0,0.39307306924825103,0,0.19653653462412551,-0.13102435641608368,0.06551217820804184,-0.06551217820804184,0,0,0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,-0.13102435641608368,0,0,0,0,0.13102435641608368,-0.13102435641608368,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.19653653462412551,0,-0.13102435641608368,0.13102435641608368,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06551217820804184,0,0,-0.13102435641608368,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0.13102435641608368,0,0.19653653462412551,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19653653462412551,-0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,-0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,0,-0.19653653462412551,0,0,0,-0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,-0.13102435641608368,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,0.06551217820804184,0,0.19653653462412551,0,0,-0.13102435641608368,0,0,0,0,0.19653653462412551,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06551217820804184,0,-0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0.06551217820804184,0,0.06551217820804184,-0.06551217820804184,0.06551217820804184,0,0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,-0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.3275608910402092,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.06551217820804184,0.06551217820804184,0,0,-0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13102435641608368,0,0,0,0.19653653462412551,0,0,-0.06551217820804184,0,0,0,-0.13102435641608368,0,0,0,0]},{"id":"quote-3","text":"I then discovered that when the immigrants came... there had been a much earlier immigration of Jews from... largely from Germany...

The Level Split operator helps you recognize when your hypothesis is mixing different levels of explanation. In biology, for instance, phenomena can be explained at the molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, organism, or population level. Brenner emphasized that confusing levels leads to muddled thinking. **The Core Insight**: When you say \"X causes Y\", are X and Y at the same level? If not, you need intermediate mechanisms. If you're measuring at one level but theorizing at another, your test may not be discriminative. Think of it like programming: you can't debug assembly by looking at the user interface. You need to match your investigation to the right abstraction level. Key question: At what level of organization is this phenomenon actually happening? When to use: Your hypothesis spans from microscale to macroscale (e.g., 'genes cause behavior'); You're unsure which measurements would actually test your claim; Different experts give contradictory-seeming evidence; The mechanism seems to 'skip' steps in the causal chain When not to use: Your hypothesis is already specific to a single level; You're comparing alternatives at the same level Brenner example: Genetic Code vs. Protein Folding. Brenner was careful to distinguish the genetic CODE (information level) from protein FOLDING (physical level). Early confusion arose because people assumed DNA \"caused\" protein structure directly. Brenner recognized these were different levels: the code specifies the sequence; physics determines the fold. This level-separation allowed him to focus on the triplet coding problem without getting distracted by folding questions that required different experimental approaches.

The Exclusion Test is THE key operator in the Brenner approach. It shifts focus from \"how do I prove I'm right?\" to \"what would prove I'm WRONG?\" **The Core Insight**: A hypothesis that can't be excluded isn't really a hypothesis — it's just a belief. Science advances by elimination. When you design an exclusion test, you're asking: what observation would force me to completely abandon this idea? The test must give a CLEAN answer. If every possible outcome is consistent with your hypothesis, you haven't designed a test — you've designed a ritual. Key question: What would prove you wrong — not 'less right' — definitively wrong? When to use: You have a clear hypothesis to test; You want to discriminate between competing explanations; You need to prioritize which experiments to run; You're not sure if your evidence is actually discriminative When not to use: You're still in exploratory mode without clear hypotheses; Your hypothesis is unfalsifiable by design (e.g., untestable metaphysics) Brenner example: The Triplet Code Exclusion. When testing whether the genetic code was based on triplets, Brenner designed experiments that could EXCLUDE alternatives. A doublet code would produce different frame-shift patterns. An overlapping code would limit which amino acid sequences were possible. He didn't just look for evidence supporting triplets — he specifically designed tests where non-triplet codes would give different, identifiable results. When those alternatives were excluded, triplets remained by elimination. Common mistakes: Designing tests where all outcomes support the hypothesis; Choosing 'safe' tests that couldn't really exclude anything; Moving the goalposts after seeing results; Confusing 'consistent with' for 'evidence for'; Ignoring negative results Success criteria: You have at least one test that could definitively exclude your hypothesis; You can state exactly what observation would prove you wrong; Your tests differentiate YOUR hypothesis from alternatives; You've written down pass/fail criteria BEFORE running the test","source":"operator","embedding":[0.02486055050818142,-0.07458165152454425,0,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,0,0,0.09944220203272568,0,0,0,0.02486055050818142,-0.02486055050818142,0.09944220203272568,0,0,0,0.04972110101636284,0,0.02486055050818142,-0.04972110101636284,0.596653212196354,-0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,0,0.04972110101636284,0,0.19888440406545135,0,0,0,0,-0.1243027525409071,0,0,0,0,0.04972110101636284,0,0.04972110101636284,-0.02486055050818142,0,-0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,-0.04972110101636284,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0,-0.04972110101636284,0,0,0,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,0,0.07458165152454425,0,0.04972110101636284,-0.02486055050818142,0,-0.17402385355726993,0.07458165152454425,0,0.04972110101636284,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0,-0.02486055050818142,0,-0.04972110101636284,0.02486055050818142,0,0,-0.07458165152454425,0.1243027525409071,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0,0,0.04972110101636284,-0.04972110101636284,0,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0,-0.07458165152454425,0,-0.22374495457363278,0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,0,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0.02486055050818142,-0.02486055050818142,0,-0.02486055050818142,0.09944220203272568,0,0,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07458165152454425,0,0,0,0.1243027525409071,-0.07458165152454425,0.09944220203272568,0,0.02486055050818142,-0.04972110101636284,0.02486055050818142,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0.17402385355726993,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,0,0.07458165152454425,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0.09944220203272568,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,0.04972110101636284,0,0,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0,-0.07458165152454425,0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07458165152454425,0,0,0,-0.09944220203272568,0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,0,-0.07458165152454425,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0.02486055050818142,-0.09944220203272568,0,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0,-0.1243027525409071,0.1243027525409071,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02486055050818142,-0.02486055050818142,0,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0.04972110101636284,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0.09944220203272568,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0,0,0.09944220203272568,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0,-0.09944220203272568,0,0,0,-0.1243027525409071,0,0,0.04972110101636284,-0.1243027525409071,0,0,0,-0.04972110101636284,0.04972110101636284,0,0,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0.02486055050818142,0,0.22374495457363278,0,0,0,0.02486055050818142,-0.09944220203272568,0,0,0,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0.07458165152454425,0,0.02486055050818142,-0.02486055050818142,0.02486055050818142,0,0.04972110101636284,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.07458165152454425,0.07458165152454425,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,0,0.04972110101636284,-0.02486055050818142,0,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,0.02486055050818142,0,0.19888440406545135,0,0.02486055050818142,-0.04972110101636284,0,0,0.02486055050818142,-0.07458165152454425,0,0,0.04972110101636284,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0,0,0,0,0.07458165152454425,0,0,0,0,-0.02486055050818142,0,0,0.02486055050818142,-0.02486055050818142,0,0]},{"id":"operator-object_transpose","text":"Consider alternative explanations by systematically transposing your view — what if the cause and effect are reversed, or a third variable explains both?

This operator makes you systematically generate alternatives and then design tests to discriminate between them. Think of it as devil's advocate, but structured.

Key question: What if you've got the direction or cause completely wrong?

Instead of always asking \"what does this gene do?\", Brenner sometimes asked \"what does this gene NOT do?\" or \"what if the observed effect is a side-effect rather than the main function?\" This transposition revealed hidden assumptions and alternative explanations. By asking the inverted question, he often discovered that phenomena attributed to one mechanism were actually caused by something else entirely. Common mistakes: Generating weak strawman alternatives; Not considering bidirectional relationships; Forgetting about selection effects; Assuming correlation direction matches causation direction; Dismissing alternatives without discriminating tests Success criteria: You've generated at least 3 serious alternative explanations; You've rated their plausibility honestly; You have discriminating tests for the most plausible alternatives; You know what evidence would distinguish your hypothesis from each alternative","source":"operator","embedding":[0.1292287382909359,-0.10338299063274872,0,-0.02584574765818718,0,0,0.05169149531637436,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0,-0.02584574765818718,0.10338299063274872,0,0,0,0,0,0.18092023360731027,0,0,-0.02584574765818718,0.02584574765818718,-0.02584574765818718,0.02584574765818718,-0.05169149531637436,0.6202979437964924,0,0,0,0,0,0.07753724297456155,0,0.20676598126549744,0,0.10338299063274872,0,0.02584574765818718,-0.07753724297456155,0,-0.07753724297456155,0,0,0,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0.02584574765818718,-0.02584574765818718,0,-0.02584574765818718,0.02584574765818718,0,0,-0.02584574765818718,0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0.05169149531637436,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.05169149531637436,0,0,0,-0.02584574765818718,0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0.10338299063274872,0,0.07753724297456155,-0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02584574765818718,-0.05169149531637436,0,-0.05169149531637436,0,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0,-0.07753724297456155,0,-0.05169149531637436,0,-0.02584574765818718,0.1292287382909359,0,0.10338299063274872,-0.02584574765818718,0,-0.02584574765818718,0,-0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0.05169149531637436,-0.02584574765818718,0,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0.10338299063274872,-0.10338299063274872,0,-0.07753724297456155,0.1550744859491231,-0.07753724297456155,0,0,0.02584574765818718,-0.02584574765818718,0,0,0.1550744859491231,-0.02584574765818718,0,-0.07753724297456155,0.05169149531637436,-0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05169149531637436,0,0.05169149531637436,-0.02584574765818718,0.07753724297456155,-0.02584574765818718,0.05169149531637436,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0.02584574765818718,-0.02584574765818718,0.10338299063274872,-0.02584574765818718,0,-0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02584574765818718,0.05169149531637436,0,0,0,0,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0.10338299063274872,0,0,0,0,-0.02584574765818718,0.02584574765818718,-0.05169149531637436,0,-0.02584574765818718,0,-0.02584574765818718,0,-0.02584574765818718,0,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02584574765818718,0,-0.02584574765818718,0,-0.05169149531637436,0,-0.05169149531637436,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0.05169149531637436,-0.02584574765818718,0,0,0.02584574765818718,-0.02584574765818718,0.10338299063274872,-0.02584574765818718,0.02584574765818718,-0.02584574765818718,0.02584574765818718,0,0,-0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.10338299063274872,0,0.02584574765818718,-0.02584574765818718,0.1292287382909359,0,0.02584574765818718,-0.02584574765818718,0.02584574765818718,0,0.05169149531637436,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0,-0.10338299063274872,0,0,0,-0.05169149531637436,0,-0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1550744859491231,0,0,0,0,-0.20676598126549744,0.07753724297456155,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0.05169149531637436,0,0,-0.05169149531637436,0,-0.02584574765818718,0.02584574765818718,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02584574765818718,0,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0,-0.02584574765818718,0.1292287382909359,0,0,-0.02584574765818718,0.07753724297456155,-0.10338299063274872,0,0,0.02584574765818718,-0.1292287382909359,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05169149531637436,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0.10338299063274872,-0.02584574765818718,0,-0.02584574765818718,0.02584574765818718,0,0,-0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0,0.07753724297456155,0,0.02584574765818718,0,0,0,0,-0.05169149531637436,0,-0.05169149531637436,0,0]},{"id":"operator-scale_check","text":"Verify that your claimed effect makes sense at the scale you're proposing — is the magnitude plausible? Does it hold at different scales? The Scale Check operator asks whether your effect size is physically and practically plausible. A 50% change in one variable might be unremarkable in one domain but revolutionary in another. **The Core Insight**: Before trusting an effect, ask whether it makes sense in magnitude. Is the claimed effect size typical for this domain? What would happen if you scaled the cause up or down by 10x? This catches both inflation (effects that seem too large to be real) and dismissal (effects that seem small but are actually important in context). Key question: Does this effect size make sense at the scale you're proposing? When to use: You have quantitative results and want to assess significance; An effect seems surprisingly large or small; You're extrapolating from a study to a different scale; You want to compare your effect to established benchmarks When not to use: You're still in qualitative/exploratory phase; The phenomenon is inherently non-quantitative Brenner example: Checking Whether Molecular Mechanisms Scale to Organism Effects. Brenner was always careful to check whether molecular-level mechanisms could actually produce organism-level effects. A mutation that changes a single protein must somehow propagate through many layers to produce the phenotype you observe. He would often do back-of-envelope calculations: if this pathway is the mechanism, what magnitude of effect should we see? Does that match observations? Common mistakes: Ignoring domain norms for effect sizes; Confusing statistical significance with practical significance; Not converting to standardized effect sizes for comparison; Assuming small effects are unimportant (or large effects are trustworthy); Forgetting that measurement error inflates some effects Success criteria: You've stated your effect size in standardized terms; You've compared to typical effects in your domain; You've assessed practical significance, not just statistical; You understand what the effect means at different scales","source":"operator","embedding":[0.04818228109232098,0,0,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.02409114054616049,0.09636456218464196,0,0,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0.07227342163848147,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.02409114054616049,0.02409114054616049,-0.07227342163848147,0,0,0.5540962325616913,0,0,0,0,0,0.12045570273080244,-0.02409114054616049,0.28909368655392587,0,0.07227342163848147,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,-0.02409114054616049,0.02409114054616049,0,0.04818228109232098,-0.02409114054616049,0.02409114054616049,0,0,-0.04818228109232098,0.07227342163848147,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02409114054616049,0,-0.02409114054616049,0.02409114054616049,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.04818228109232098,0,0,0,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04818228109232098,0,-0.04818228109232098,0,0,0,-0.1927291243692839,0.04818228109232098,0,0.07227342163848147,-0.02409114054616049,0.04818228109232098,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,-0.09636456218464196,0.02409114054616049,-0.2168202649154444,0,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.07227342163848147,0,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.02409114054616049,0,-0.02409114054616049,0.02409114054616049,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.09636456218464196,0,0,0.07227342163848147,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07227342163848147,-0.02409114054616049,0.02409114054616049,-0.02409114054616049,0.12045570273080244,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1927291243692839,0,0.04818228109232098,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02409114054616049,0.16863798382312342,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.04818228109232098,0.09636456218464196,-0.04818228109232098,0,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0.04818228109232098,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0.07227342163848147,0,0,-0.04818228109232098,0,-0.02409114054616049,0,-0.07227342163848147,0,-0.07227342163848147,0,0,0,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0.04818228109232098,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.04818228109232098,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02409114054616049,0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0.04818228109232098,0,0.04818228109232098,0,0,-0.02409114054616049,0.02409114054616049,0,0,-0.04818228109232098,0.02409114054616049,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04818228109232098,0,0,0,0.12045570273080244,0,0.09636456218464196,0,0,0,0.04818228109232098,0,0,0,0,-0.12045570273080244,0,0,0,-0.04818228109232098,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0.04818228109232098,-0.02409114054616049,0.02409114054616049,-0.02409114054616049,0.14454684327696293,0,0,0,0,-0.07227342163848147,0.09636456218464196,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.04818228109232098,0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0.09636456218464196,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0.28909368655392587,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09636456218464196,-0.09636456218464196,0,-0.04818228109232098,0,0,0.14454684327696293,0,0.04818228109232098,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0.12045570273080244,-0.02409114054616049,0,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0.02409114054616049,0,0.04818228109232098,0,0,0,0.07227342163848147,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02409114054616049,-0.07227342163848147,0,0]}]}

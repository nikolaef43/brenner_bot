{"id":"brenner_bot-02l","title":"TanStack Query: Create Session Kickoff Mutation","description":"# Goal\nCreate a useMutation hook for the session creation form submission, replacing the current server action pattern.\n\n## Background\nCurrently, session creation uses a Next.js server action:\n```typescript\n// apps/web/src/app/sessions/new/page.tsx\nasync function sendKickoff(formData: FormData): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n  'use server';\n  // ... validation and Agent Mail call\n}\n```\n\nThis works but lacks:\n1. Loading state management\n2. Error handling UI\n3. Optimistic updates\n4. Retry logic\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Create useSessionMutation hook\n```typescript\n// apps/web/src/hooks/mutations/useSessionMutation.ts\nimport { useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';\n\ninterface SessionInput {\n  threadId: string;\n  hypothesis: string;\n  priors: string;\n  agent: string;\n}\n\nexport function useSessionMutation() {\n  const queryClient = useQueryClient();\n  \n  return useMutation({\n    mutationFn: async (input: SessionInput) =\u003e {\n      const response = await fetch('/api/sessions', {\n        method: 'POST',\n        body: JSON.stringify(input),\n      });\n      if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to create session');\n      return response.json();\n    },\n    onSuccess: () =\u003e {\n      // Invalidate session list if we have one\n      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['sessions'] });\n    },\n    onError: (error) =\u003e {\n      // Could integrate with toast notifications\n      console.error('Session creation failed:', error);\n    },\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Create API route (if not using server action)\nIf we move away from server actions, create:\n```typescript\n// apps/web/src/app/api/sessions/route.ts\nexport async function POST(request: Request) {\n  const body = await request.json();\n  // ... validation and Agent Mail call\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update form component\n```typescript\nconst mutation = useSessionMutation();\n\nconst handleSubmit = (data: SessionInput) =\u003e {\n  mutation.mutate(data, {\n    onSuccess: () =\u003e {\n      // Show success, redirect, etc.\n    },\n  });\n};\n\n// In JSX:\n{mutation.isPending \u0026\u0026 \u003cLoadingSpinner /\u003e}\n{mutation.isError \u0026\u0026 \u003cErrorMessage error={mutation.error} /\u003e}\n```\n\n## Considerations\n\n### Server Actions vs API Routes\nDecision: Keep server action for now, wrap with mutation for state.\nTanStack Query can work with server actions via a wrapper.\n\n### Optimistic Updates\nFor now, just show loading/success. Session list doesn't exist yet.\nFuture: Add optimistic session to list before confirmation.\n\n### Error Types\nDefine specific error types:\n- ValidationError (user input issues)\n- NetworkError (Agent Mail unreachable)\n- AuthError (not authenticated)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] useSessionMutation hook created\n- [ ] Form shows loading state during submission\n- [ ] Form shows error state on failure\n- [ ] Success triggers appropriate UI feedback\n- [ ] TypeScript types are complete\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- apps/web/src/hooks/mutations/useSessionMutation.ts (create)\n- apps/web/src/app/sessions/new/page.tsx (use hook)\n- apps/web/src/app/api/sessions/route.ts (optional)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-29T23:16:41.085061423-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-30T00:26:38.959003392-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-30T00:26:38.959003392-05:00","close_reason":"Infrastructure complete: Created useSessionMutation hook (hooks/mutations/), API route (/api/sessions/route.ts), and SessionForm client component.

{"id":"brenner_bot-1r5","title":"TanStack Query: Create Corpus Query Hooks","description":"# Goal\nCreate reusable query hooks for all corpus data fetching operations. These hooks will replace direct async calls and provide automatic caching.\n\n## Background\nCurrently, corpus data is fetched via:\n- `readCorpusDoc(id)` - reads and parses a single document\n- `listCorpusDocs()` - lists all available documents\n- `corpusSearch.ts` - has manual caching with module-level variables\n\nThe 473KB transcript is re-parsed on every page load. With Query, it will be cached.\n\n## Hooks to Create\n\n### 1. useCorpusDoc(id: string)\n```typescript\n// apps/web/src/hooks/queries/useCorpusDoc.ts\nexport function useCorpusDoc(id: string) {\n  return useQuery({\n    queryKey: ['corpus', 'doc', id],\n    queryFn: () =\u003e readCorpusDoc(id),\n    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes\n    gcTime: 30 * 60 * 1000,   // 30 minutes\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### 2. useCorpusList()\n```typescript\n// apps/web/src/hooks/queries/useCorpusList.ts\nexport function useCorpusList() {\n  return useQuery({\n    queryKey: ['corpus', 'list'],\n    queryFn: listCorpusDocs,\n    staleTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes (list changes rarely)\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### 3. useCorpusSearch(query: string, options)\nReplace the manual cache in corpusSearch.ts with Query.\n\n## Query Key Design\nUsing hierarchical keys enables selective invalidation:\n- `['corpus']` - invalidate everything\n- `['corpus', 'doc', id]` - invalidate one document\n- `['corpus', 'list']` - invalidate the list\n\n## Considerations\n\n### Server-Side Prefetching\nFor SSR, we can prefetch in Server Components:\n```typescript\n// In page.tsx (Server Component)\nconst queryClient = new QueryClient();\nawait queryClient.prefetchQuery({\n  queryKey: ['corpus', 'doc', id],\n  queryFn: () =\u003e readCorpusDoc(id),\n});\n// Pass to client via HydrationBoundary\n```\n\n### Error Handling\nQuery provides automatic retry and error states. Define custom error types for:\n- Document not found (404)\n- Parse error\n- File system error\n\n### Loading States\nQuery provides `isLoading`, `isFetching`, `isError` states. Use these instead of manual loading state management.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] useCorpusDoc hook works and caches correctly\n- [ ] useCorpusList hook works and caches correctly\n- [ ] Query keys follow hierarchical convention\n- [ ] TypeScript types are fully inferred\n- [ ] Hooks are exported from a central location\n\n## Files to Create\n- apps/web/src/hooks/queries/useCorpusDoc.ts\n- apps/web/src/hooks/queries/useCorpusList.ts\n- apps/web/src/hooks/queries/useCorpusSearch.ts\n- apps/web/src/hooks/queries/index.ts (re-export)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-29T23:15:28.321690593-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-29T23:33:51.46723958-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-29T23:33:51.46723958-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented TanStack Query hooks for corpus: useCorpusDoc, useCorpusList, useCorpusSearch.

Enable researchers to understand the overall state of their research without reading every session artifact.\n\n## Background\nThe Brenner method naturally spans multiple sessions. Currently, there is no way to get a high-level view. This dashboard provides that view.\n\n## Research Program Concept\n\nA **Research Program** groups related sessions:\n\n```typescript\ninterface ResearchProgram {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  description: string;\n  sessions: string[];\n  createdAt: string;\n  status: \"active\" | \"paused\" | \"completed\" | \"abandoned\";\n  notes?: string;\n}\n```\n\n## Dashboard Components\n\n### 1. Hypothesis Funnel\nVisual representation of hypothesis lifecycle with breakdown by origin:\n```\nProposed: 12 (8 original, 3 third-alternative, 1 anomaly-spawned)\n    ↓\nActive: 5  |  Under Attack: 2  |  Assumption-Undermined: 1\n    ↓\nKilled: 6  |  Validated: 0  |  Dormant: 1\n```\n\n### 2. Registry Health Metrics\n\n**Hypothesis Registry:**\n- Total hypotheses: Count by state\n- Kill rate: Killed / (Killed + Active + Validated)\n- Third alternative coverage: % of hypothesis sets with third alt\n\n**Assumption Registry:**\n- Unchecked assumptions: Count (warning if \u003e 5)\n- Scale/physics checks: Count (warning if 0!)\n- Falsified assumptions: Count + impact (which hypotheses affected)\n\n**Anomaly Registry:**\n- Active anomalies: Count (unresolved puzzles)\n- Deferred anomalies: Count (parked questions)\n- Paradigm-shifting: Count (if \u003e 0, major finding!)\n- Resolution rate: Resolved / Total\n\n**Critique Registry:**\n- Active critiques: Count (unaddressed attacks)\n- Critiques by severity: minor/moderate/serious/critical breakdown\n- Response rate: Addressed / Total\n- Hypothesis under attack: List (high unaddressed count)\n\n### 3.

{"id":"brenner_bot-30st","title":"Feature: Artifact Semantic Diff (Version Evolution Viewer)","description":"# Goal\nImplement semantic diffing between artifact versions to show WHAT changed, not just WHETHER it is valid.\n\n## The Gap This Fills\n\nOther agents covered:\n- Artifact linting (validates structure, reports errors/warnings)\n- Artifact merge (combines deltas into artifacts)\n- Results encoding (how experiment outputs become deltas)\n\n**What nobody covered:** When you compile v2 of an artifact, you see a lint report saying \"2 errors, 5 warnings\" - but you do NOT see:\n- \"Added hypothesis H4 (Epigenetic microcode)\"\n- \"Killed hypothesis H2 (Gradient reading) with rationale: contradicted by T3 results\"\n- \"Refined test T1: added potency check\"\n- \"New assumption A6 added by adversarial_critic\"\n\nThe lint report tells you validity; the semantic diff tells you evolution.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n1. **Research Progress Visibility** - At a glance, see what changed between rounds. Did agents make progress or just churn?\n\n2. **Critique Evaluation** - After a critique round, did agents address the feedback? The diff shows what was actually changed.\n\n3. **Operator Decision Support** - Should I publish v2? The diff helps operators understand if changes are improvements.\n\n4. **Debugging Bad Sessions** - If a session went wrong, the diff history shows where things diverged.\n\n5. **Learning from Good Sessions** - Study how successful research evolved: what got killed early, what survived, what emerged late.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. Semantic Diff Data Structure\n\n```typescript\ninterface ArtifactDiff {\n  from_version: number;\n  to_version: number;\n  changes: {\n    hypothesis_slate: {\n      added: Array\u003c{ id: string; name: string; by_agent: string }\u003e;\n      killed: Array\u003c{ id: string; name: string; rationale: string; by_agent: string }\u003e;\n      edited: Array\u003c{ id: string; field: string; old_value: string; new_value: string }\u003e;\n    };\n    test_battery: {\n      added: Array\u003c{ id: string; name: string; targets: string[] }\u003e;\n      edited: Array\u003c{ id: string; field: string; old_value: string; new_value: string }\u003e;\n    };\n    assumption_ledger: {\n      added: Array\u003c{ id: string; assumption: string; by_agent: string }\u003e;\n      challenged: Array\u003c{ id: string; challenger: string; challenge: string }\u003e;\n    };\n    critiques: {\n      added: Array\u003c{ id: string; target: string; critique: string; by_agent: string }\u003e;\n      resolved: Array\u003c{ id: string; resolution: string }\u003e;\n    };\n    anomaly_quarantine: {\n      added: Array\u003c{ id: string; description: string }\u003e;\n      promoted: Array\u003c{ id: string; promoted_to: string }\u003e; // anomaly became hypothesis\n      dismissed: Array\u003c{ id: string; reason: string }\u003e;\n    };\n  };\n  summary: {\n    hypotheses_net: number;  // added - killed\n    tests_added: number;\n    critiques_resolved: number;\n    progress_score: number;  // heuristic: are we making progress?\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Diff Generation Algorithm\n\n```\n1. Parse both artifact versions into normalized structures\n2. For each section (hypothesis_slate, test_battery, etc.):\n   a. Index items by ID\n   b. Compare: items in v2 not in v1 = added\n   c. Compare: items in v1 not in v2 = killed/removed\n   d. Compare: items in both with different values = edited\n3. For KILL operations specifically, preserve rationale from delta\n4. Calculate summary statistics\n```\n\n### 3. Display Formats\n\n**CLI Output:**\n```\n=== Artifact Diff: v1 → v2 ===\n  \nHYPOTHESES\n  + [H4] Epigenetic microcode (by: GreenCastle)\n  ✗ [H2] Gradient reading - KILLED: \"contradicted by T3 results\" (by: RedForest)\n  ~ [H1] Lineage counting - edited: mechanism field refined\n  \nTESTS  \n  + [T5] Digital handle task (targets: H1, H4)\n  ~ [T1] Scale boundary probe - edited: added potency check\n  \nASSUMPTIONS\n  + [A6] Cells have stable chromatin state inheritance (by: RedForest)\n  \nCRITIQUES\n  ✓ [C1] Missing potency check - RESOLVED by T1 edit\n  + [C4] H4 mechanism underspecified (by: BlueMountain)\n  \nSUMMARY: +1 hypothesis, +1 test, 1 critique resolved | Progress: MODERATE\n```\n\n**Web UI:**\n- Side-by-side or inline diff view\n- Expandable sections\n- Color-coded: green=added, red=killed, yellow=edited\n- Filter by section type or agent\n\n### 4. Integration Points\n\n- **After Compile:** Show diff from previous version in compile preview\n- **Session Detail Page:** \"Changes\" tab showing diff history\n- **CLI:** `brenner session diff \u003cthreadId\u003e [v1] [v2]`\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] `diffArtifacts(v1, v2)` function in artifact-merge.ts or new diff module\n- [ ] Diff includes all sections: hypotheses, tests, assumptions, critiques, anomalies\n- [ ] KILL operations preserve rationale in diff output\n- [ ] CLI command `brenner session diff` implemented\n- [ ] Web session detail page shows diff between versions\n- [ ] Summary statistics calculated (net changes, progress heuristic)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Requires multiple artifact versions (already exists via COMPILED messages)\n- Independent of cross-session linking (brenner_bot-prmc)\n\n## Non-Goals\n\n- Not implementing AI-powered \"semantic similarity\" (e.g., detecting renamed hypotheses)\n- Not building revision history UI (showing all versions) - just v1→v2 diff\n- Not computing \"quality\" of changes (thats evaluation rubric territory)\n\n## Example Use Case\n\nOperator runs a critique round. Agents respond with deltas. Operator compiles v2.\n\nWithout semantic diff:\n```\nCompiled v2 (lint: 0 errors, 3 warnings)\n```\n\nWith semantic diff:\n```\nCompiled v2 (lint: 0 errors, 3 warnings)\n\nChanges from v1:\n  - Killed H2 (Gradient reading) - agents agreed T3 refuted it\n  - Added T5 to test the surviving hypotheses\n  - Resolved 2/3 critiques from round 1\n  - New critique: H4 mechanism still underspecified\n  \nProgress: GOOD - hypotheses narrowing, tests targeting survivors\n```\n\nThe operator can now make an informed decision about publishing.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-30T19:00:40.866901891-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-30T22:43:36.70824586-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"brenner_bot-30st","depends_on_id":"brenner_bot-jcuz","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-30T22:38:33.056561414-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"brenner_bot-3fy","title":"TanStack Query: Remove Manual Caching from corpusSearch.ts","description":"# Goal\nRemove the manual caching implementation in corpusSearch.ts and replace with Query.\n\n## Background\ncorpusSearch.ts currently has manual cache management:\n```typescript\nlet cachedSections: Section[] | null = null;\nlet cacheTimestamp: number | null = null;\nconst CACHE_TTL = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes\n\nexport async function searchCorpus(query: string) {\n  // Check cache freshness\n  if (cachedSections \u0026\u0026 cacheTimestamp \u0026\u0026 \n      Date.now() - cacheTimestamp \u003c CACHE_TTL) {\n    return searchInSections(cachedSections, query);\n  }\n  \n  // Refresh cache\n  cachedSections = await loadAllSections();\n  cacheTimestamp = Date.now();\n  return searchInSections(cachedSections, query);\n}\n```\n\nThis pattern has issues:\n1. Cache is module-scoped (memory leak potential in serverless)\n2. No way to invalidate\n3. Duplicates Query's functionality\n4. No loading/error states exposed\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Create useCorpusSections hook\n```typescript\nexport function useCorpusSections() {\n  return useQuery({\n    queryKey: ['corpus', 'sections', 'all'],\n    queryFn: loadAllSections,\n    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Create useCorpusSearch hook\n```typescript\nexport function useCorpusSearch(query: string) {\n  const { data: sections } = useCorpusSections();\n  \n  return useQuery({\n    queryKey: ['corpus', 'search', query],\n    queryFn: () =\u003e searchInSections(sections!, query),\n    enabled: !!sections \u0026\u0026 query.length \u003e= 2,\n    staleTime: Infinity, // Search results don't go stale\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Remove module-level cache variables\nDelete cachedSections, cacheTimestamp, CACHE_TTL.\n\n### 4. Simplify corpusSearch.ts\nKeep only pure functions:\n- loadAllSections() - no caching logic\n- searchInSections(sections, query) - pure search\n\n## Considerations\n\n### Debouncing\nSearch queries should be debounced at the UI level, not here.\nThe QuoteBankViewer already has search input - ensure it debounces.\n\n### Query Enabled State\nOnly run search query when:\n- Sections are loaded\n- Query is at least 2 characters\n\n### Memory Usage\nQuery's gcTime will clean up old search results automatically.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Module-level cache variables removed\n- [ ] useCorpusSections hook created\n- [ ] useCorpusSearch hook created\n- [ ] Search still works in QuoteBankViewer\n- [ ] Memory usage doesn't grow unbounded\n- [ ] Code is ~50% shorter\n\n## Files to Modify\n- apps/web/src/lib/corpusSearch.ts (simplify)\n- apps/web/src/hooks/queries/useCorpusSearch.ts (create)\n- apps/web/src/components/quotebank/QuoteBankViewer.tsx (use hook)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-29T23:16:17.507575937-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-30T00:02:39.375034255-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-30T00:02:39.375034255-05:00","close_reason":"Removed module-level cache variables from corpusSearch.ts. getSections() renamed to loadSections() - caching now handled by TanStack Query at hook level.

{"id":"brenner_bot-4u0u","title":"Spec: Session Replay and Deterministic Reproducibility","description":"# Goal\nDefine the infrastructure for recording and replaying Brenner Loop sessions to enable deterministic reproducibility, debugging, and training.\n\n## The Gap This Fills\n\nOther agents covered:\n- Experiment execution (running tests)\n- Results encoding (capturing outputs)\n- Operator audit trail (tracking interventions)\n- Cross-session linking (referencing prior sessions)\n\n**What nobody covered:** Given a sessions inputs, can you REPLAY the session? Specifically:\n\n1. Can I re-run \"RS-20251230-bio-rrp\" with the same inputs and verify I get the same (or similar) outputs?\n2. Can I replay a session with DIFFERENT agents to compare their reasoning?\n3. Can I use a \"golden session\" as training data for new agents?\n4. If two sessions diverged unexpectedly, can I diff their execution traces?\n\nThis is the **scientific reproducibility** problem applied to multi-agent research.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n### 1. Research Integrity\nA published finding should be reproducible. If Session X concluded \"H1 is correct\", can we verify that conclusion by replaying Session X?\n\n### 2. Debugging Divergence\nTwo agents receive the same kickoff but produce wildly different deltas. Replay with logging to understand WHERE and WHY they diverged.\n\n### 3. Agent Evaluation\nNew agent models are released. Replay historical sessions to compare performance:\n- Does Claude Opus 5 produce better hypotheses than Opus 4.5?\n- Does the new role prompt improve test design?\n\n### 4. Training and Onboarding\nNew agents can \"shadow\" historical sessions - see the inputs, predict what they would output, compare to what the original agents produced.\n\n### 5. A/B Testing Protocol Changes\nChange the delta format, replay sessions, measure impact on artifact quality.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. Session Recording (Capture)\n\nEvery session automatically captures a **Session Record**:\n\n```typescript\ninterface SessionRecord {\n  id: string;\n  created_at: string;\n  \n  // Inputs (deterministic)\n  inputs: {\n    kickoff: {\n      thread_id: string;\n      excerpt: string;\n      theme?: string;\n      domain?: string;\n      question?: string;\n      operator_selection: OperatorSelection;\n    };\n    external_evidence: ExternalEvidence[];\n    agent_roster: {\n      agent_name: string;\n      role: Role;\n      model: string;\n      model_version: string;\n    }[];\n    protocol_versions: {\n      role_prompts: string;  // Git hash or version\n      delta_format: string;\n      artifact_schema: string;\n    };\n  };\n  \n  // Execution trace\n  trace: {\n    rounds: Array\u003c{\n      round_number: number;\n      messages: Array\u003c{\n        timestamp: string;\n        from: string;\n        type: \"DELTA\" | \"CRITIQUE\" | \"ACK\" | ...;\n        content_hash: string;  // SHA256 of message body\n        content_length: number;\n      }\u003e;\n      compiled_artifact_hash?: string;\n    }\u003e;\n    interventions: OperatorIntervention[];\n    total_duration_ms: number;\n  };\n  \n  // Outputs\n  outputs: {\n    final_artifact_hash: string;\n    lint_result: { errors: number; warnings: number; valid: boolean };\n    hypothesis_count: number;\n    test_count: number;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Session Replay Modes\n\n#### A. Verification Replay\nRe-run with same agents/models to verify outputs match.\n- Input: SessionRecord\n- Output: { matches: boolean; divergences: Divergence[] }\n\n#### B. Comparison Replay\nRe-run with different agents to compare.\n- Input: SessionRecord + new agent roster\n- Output: ComparisonReport showing delta differences\n\n#### C. Trace Replay\nStep through recorded messages without re-running agents.\n- Input: SessionRecord\n- Output: Interactive viewer showing message-by-message flow\n\n### 3. Determinism Challenges\n\nLLMs are inherently non-deterministic. Replay cannot guarantee identical outputs, but we can:\n\n1. **Seed control**: If agents support seeded sampling, record and replay seeds\n2. **Semantic comparison**: Compare outputs semantically, not byte-for-byte\n3. **Bound divergence**: Define acceptable divergence thresholds\n4. **Record temperature**: Capture and replay inference parameters\n\n### 4. Storage and Retrieval\n\n```bash\n# Record is auto-saved after session closes\n~/.brenner/sessions/RS-20251230-bio-rrp/record.json\n\n# Retrieve record\nbrenner session record \u003cthreadId\u003e --output record.json\n\n# Replay in verification mode\nbrenner session replay record.json --mode verify\n\n# Replay with different agents\nbrenner session replay record.json --mode compare --roster new_roster.json\n```\n\n### 5. Replay Report\n\n```markdown\n# Session Replay Report\n\n## Summary\n- Original session: RS-20251230-bio-rrp\n- Replay mode: verification\n- Replay date: 2025-12-31T10:00:00Z\n- Agents: [same as original]\n\n## Results\n- Rounds completed: 2/2 ✓\n- Message count match: 12/12 ✓\n- Final artifact similarity: 94%\n\n## Divergences\n1. Round 1, Message 4 (hypothesis_generator)\n   - Original: Proposed H4 with mechanism X\n   - Replay: Proposed H4 with mechanism X (slightly different wording)\n   - Semantic match: YES\n   \n2. Round 2, Message 8 (test_designer)\n   - Original: T5 with 3 predicted outcomes\n   - Replay: T5 with 4 predicted outcomes\n   - Semantic match: PARTIAL (additional outcome is valid)\n\n## Conclusion\nSession is reproducible within acceptable bounds.\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] `SessionRecord` type defined with inputs, trace, outputs\n- [ ] Auto-capture of session records on session close\n- [ ] CLI `brenner session record \u003cthreadId\u003e` to export record\n- [ ] CLI `brenner session replay \u003crecord\u003e --mode verify|compare|trace`\n- [ ] Verification replay produces match/divergence report\n- [ ] Comparison replay with alternate roster produces comparison report\n- [ ] Session records stored in `~/.brenner/sessions/\u003cid\u003e/`\n- [ ] Web UI can display session traces (read-only replay)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Session compile/publish (exists)\n- Operator audit trail (brenner_bot-mqg7) - interventions included in record\n- Agent roster (brenner_bot-5so.12.1.x) - needed for roster capture\n\n## Non-Goals\n\n- Not implementing \"time travel debugging\" (pause/resume mid-session)\n- Not guaranteeing bit-identical replay (LLMs are stochastic)\n- Not building a full experiment tracking system (MLflow-style)\n- Not replaying experiments (that is experiment sandbox territory)\n\n## Background: Why Reproducibility Matters\n\nThe replication crisis in science shows that many published results cannot be reproduced.

{"id":"brenner_bot-59l","title":"TanStack Store: Create Reading Position Persistence","description":"# Goal\nImplement persistent reading position tracking so users don't lose their place when navigating.\n\n## Background\nUsers read long documents (transcript: 236 sections, distillations: 10-30 sections).\nCurrently, when they navigate away and return:\n- Scroll position resets to top\n- Active section is lost\n- Reading progress is gone\n\nThis is frustrating for serious readers who study the material over multiple sessions.\n\n## User Stories\n1. \"I was reading section 142 of the transcript, clicked a link, and came back - I want to resume where I was.\"\n2. \"I'm comparing Opus vs GPT distillations - I want my position in each to be remembered.\"\n3. \"I closed my browser yesterday mid-way through reading - I want to pick up where I left off.\"\n\n## Store Schema\n```typescript\ninterface ReadingStore {\n  // Per-document reading positions\n  positions: Record\u003cstring, {\n    scrollY: number;          // Pixel offset (for smooth restore)\n    activeSection: number;    // Section index (for TOC highlight)\n    lastRead: number;         // Timestamp (for recency sorting)\n  }\u003e;\n  \n  // Actions\n  savePosition: (docId: string, scrollY: number, section: number) =\u003e void;\n  getPosition: (docId: string) =\u003e { scrollY: number; activeSection: number } | null;\n  clearPosition: (docId: string) =\u003e void;\n  getRecentDocs: (limit: number) =\u003e string[];\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Create the store\n```typescript\nimport { Store } from '@tanstack/store';\n\nconst readingStore = new Store\u003cReadingState\u003e({\n  positions: {},\n});\n\n// Actions\nexport function saveReadingPosition(docId: string, scrollY: number, section: number) {\n  readingStore.setState((state) =\u003e ({\n    positions: {\n      ...state.positions,\n      [docId]: { scrollY, activeSection: section, lastRead: Date.now() },\n    },\n  }));\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Add persistence\n```typescript\nimport { persist, createJSONStorage } from 'zustand/middleware';\n// Or implement custom persistence:\n\n// Subscribe to store changes\nreadingStore.subscribe(() =\u003e {\n  localStorage.setItem('brenner-reading', JSON.stringify(readingStore.state));\n});\n\n// Hydrate on load\nconst saved = localStorage.getItem('brenner-reading');\nif (saved) {\n  readingStore.setState(JSON.parse(saved));\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Create React hook\n```typescript\nimport { useStore } from '@tanstack/react-store';\n\nexport function useReadingPosition(docId: string) {\n  const position = useStore(readingStore, (state) =\u003e state.positions[docId]);\n  \n  return {\n    position,\n    save: (scrollY: number, section: number) =\u003e \n      saveReadingPosition(docId, scrollY, section),\n    clear: () =\u003e clearReadingPosition(docId),\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Integrate with TranscriptViewer\n```typescript\nfunction TranscriptViewer({ docId }) {\n  const { position, save } = useReadingPosition(docId);\n  \n  // Restore position on mount\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    if (position) {\n      window.scrollTo(0, position.scrollY);\n    }\n  }, []);\n  \n  // Save position on scroll (debounced)\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    const handleScroll = debounce(() =\u003e {\n      save(window.scrollY, activeSection);\n    }, 500);\n    \n    window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);\n    return () =\u003e window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);\n  }, [save, activeSection]);\n}\n```\n\n## Considerations\n\n### Debouncing\nDon't save on every scroll event - debounce to 500ms.\n\n### Storage Limits\nlocalStorage has ~5MB limit. Reading positions are tiny (~100 bytes each).\nCould store thousands of positions safely.\n\n### Stale Positions\nIf document structure changes, saved positions may be invalid.\nGraceful fallback: if section index \u003e total sections, reset to 0.\n\n### Cross-Tab Sync\nOptional: Use storage event to sync across tabs.\n```typescript\nwindow.addEventListener('storage', (e) =\u003e {\n  if (e.key === 'brenner-reading') {\n    readingStore.setState(JSON.parse(e.newValue));\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Virtual List Integration\nWhen using Virtual (Task brenner_bot-90k), scroll restoration is different:\n```typescript\nvirtualizer.scrollToIndex(position.activeSection, { align: 'start' });\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Reading positions persist to localStorage\n- [ ] Positions restore on page load\n- [ ] Debounced saving (not on every scroll)\n- [ ] Recent documents trackable\n- [ ] Works with virtualized lists\n- [ ] Graceful fallback for invalid positions\n\n## Files to Create\n- apps/web/src/stores/readingStore.ts\n- apps/web/src/hooks/useReadingPosition.ts\n\n## Files to Modify\n- apps/web/src/components/transcript/TranscriptViewer.tsx\n- apps/web/src/components/distillation/DistillationViewer.tsx","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-29T23:19:56.229340994-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-30T00:05:34.915976454-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-30T00:05:34.915976454-05:00","close_reason":"Completed: Fixed React Compiler lint errors in useReadingPosition hook by changing API from shouldRestore to canRestore+markRestored pattern.

This fills a CRITICAL gap in the current design.\n\n## Why This Is Needed\n\nThe Brenner method emphasizes:\n- §58: \"The imprisoned imagination\" — scale constraints are load-bearing assumptions\n- §147: Exclusion requires knowing WHAT you're assuming\n- Artifact Schema Section 5: Assumption Ledger with Statement, Load, Test, Status\n\nCurrent gap: The Research Intelligence System tracks hypotheses and tests but **completely ignores assumptions**. This means:\n- We can't answer \"what assumptions does H1 depend on?\"\n- We can't propagate invalidation (if A1 is wrong, which hypotheses are affected?)\n- The Scorecard's \"Assumption Tracking\" dimension has no data source!\n\n## Schema Design\n\n```typescript\nexport const AssumptionTypeSchema = z.enum([\n  'background',       // Domain knowledge assumed true\n  'methodological',   // Assumptions about experimental approach\n  'boundary',         // Scope/applicability assumptions\n  'scale_physics',    // Physical/mathematical constraints (MANDATORY to have at least one!)\n]);\n\nexport const AssumptionStatusSchema = z.enum([\n  'unchecked',   // Not yet validated\n  'challenged',  // Someone has questioned it\n  'verified',    // Evidence supports it\n  'falsified',   // Evidence contradicts it\n]);\n\nexport const AssumptionSchema = z.object({\n  /** Stable ID: A-{session_id}-{sequence} */\n  id: z.string().regex(/^A-[A-Z0-9]+-\\d{3}$/),\n  \n  /** What are we assuming is true? */\n  statement: z.string().min(10),\n  \n  /** Type of assumption */\n  type: AssumptionTypeSchema,\n  \n  /** What breaks if this is wrong?

Get rid of them.\" — Hypotheses MUST be killable\n- §103: \"Both could be wrong\" — Third alternatives are first-class citizens\n- §147: \"Exclusion is always a tremendously good thing\" — The goal is to reduce the hypothesis space\n\nA hypothesis is not a thing to be proven, but a thing to be tested and, ideally, eliminated.\n\n## State Machine Design\n\n```\n                    ┌─────────────┐\n                    │  proposed   │\n                    └──────┬──────┘\n                           │ activate\n                           ▼\n                    ┌─────────────┐\n            ┌───────│   active    │───────┐\n            │       └──────┬──────┘       │\n            │ refine       │ test         │ park\n            ▼              │              ▼\n     ┌─────────────┐       │       ┌─────────────┐\n     │  refined    │       │       │   dormant   │\n     └─────────────┘       │       └─────────────┘\n            │              │              │\n            │              ▼              │ reactivate\n            │     ┌────────────────┐      │\n            │     │ test executed  │      │\n            │     └───────┬────────┘      │\n            │             │               │\n            │    ┌────────┴────────┐      │\n            │    ▼                 ▼      │\n     ┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐\n     │   killed    │       │  validated  │\n     └─────────────┘       └─────────────┘\n```\n\n## State Definitions\n\n1. **proposed** — Initial state.

Tests are being designed/executed against it.\n3. **refined** — Replaced by a more precise version. Links to child hypothesis.\n4. **killed** — Invalidated by a test result. Terminal state (no resurrection!).\n5. **validated** — Survived a discriminative test designed to kill it. Rare and provisional.\n6. **dormant** — Parked for later.

Replace `oklch` gradient colors with brenner design tokens\n2. Use existing CSS animations from globals.css instead of framer-motion springs\n3. Match rounded-xl pattern from existing Card component\n4. Use existing primary/accent/muted-foreground tokens\n\n### Structural Changes\n1. Categories: operators, brenner, biology, bayesian, method, project\n2. Add links to transcript §n anchors for biology terms\n3. Connect to /corpus/[doc] routes for \"learn more\"\n4. No motion library - use CSS animations or simple transitions\n\n### Missing from Reference (add for BrennerBot)\n1. Category icons (different icon per category)\n2. Transcript anchor links in \"why\" sections\n3.

{"id":"brenner_bot-90k","title":"TanStack Virtual: Virtualize TranscriptViewer Sections","description":"# Goal\nVirtualize the TranscriptViewer to only render visible sections, reducing DOM nodes from 236 to ~10.\n\n## Why Priority 0?\nThe transcript is the MOST viewed page. It contains 236 sections. Currently all render at once causing:\n- Slow initial paint (3+ seconds on slow devices)\n- Janky scrolling\n- High memory usage\n- Poor Core Web Vitals\n\nThis is the single highest-impact performance optimization.\n\n## Current Implementation\n```typescript\n// TranscriptViewer.tsx\n{data.sections.map((section, index) =\u003e (\n  \u003cdiv key={section.number} ref={(el) =\u003e { sectionRefs.current[index] = el; }}\u003e\n    \u003cTranscriptSection section={section} isActive={activeSection === index} /\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n))}\n```\n\nThis renders ALL 236 sections into the DOM.\n\n## Target Implementation\n```typescript\nimport { useVirtualizer } from '@tanstack/react-virtual';\n\nfunction TranscriptViewer({ data }) {\n  const parentRef = useRef\u003cHTMLDivElement\u003e(null);\n  \n  const virtualizer = useVirtualizer({\n    count: data.sections.length,\n    getScrollElement: () =\u003e parentRef.current,\n    estimateSize: () =\u003e 200, // Estimated section height\n    overscan: 3, // Render 3 extra above/below viewport\n  });\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv ref={parentRef} style={{ height: '100vh', overflow: 'auto' }}\u003e\n      \u003cdiv style={{ height: virtualizer.getTotalSize() }}\u003e\n        {virtualizer.getVirtualItems().map((virtualRow) =\u003e {\n          const section = data.sections[virtualRow.index];\n          return (\n            \u003cdiv\n              key={section.number}\n              style={{\n                position: 'absolute',\n                top: 0,\n                transform: \\`translateY(${virtualRow.start}px)\\`,\n                width: '100%',\n              }}\n              ref={virtualizer.measureElement}\n            \u003e\n              \u003cTranscriptSection section={section} /\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n          );\n        })}\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Key Challenges\n\n### 1. Variable Height Sections\nSections have different heights (some are 2 lines, some are 20).\nSolution: Use `measureElement` for dynamic measurement.\n\n### 2. Scroll Position Restoration\nWhen navigating back, should restore scroll position.\nSolution: Integrate with TanStack Store (later task).\n\n### 3. Active Section Tracking\nCurrently uses IntersectionObserver to track which section is visible.\nSolution: Virtual provides `scrollToIndex` and we can derive active from virtualizer state.\n\n### 4. TOC Navigation\nClicking TOC item should scroll to that section.\nSolution: `virtualizer.scrollToIndex(index, { align: 'start' })`\n\n### 5. URL Hash Links\nDirect links like `/corpus/transcript#section-42` should work.\nSolution: On mount, parse hash and scroll to index.\n\n## Considerations\n\n### Scroll Container\nTranscript uses `window` scroll currently. Virtual works best with a dedicated scroll container.\nTrade-off: Slightly different feel, but much better performance.\n\n### SSR Compatibility\nVirtual is client-only. Need to handle hydration:\n- Option A: Render first N sections on server, virtualize on client\n- Option B: Render placeholder, full virtualize on client\n\n### Reading Progress\nThe ReadingProgress component calculates scroll percentage.\nWith virtualization, calculate from `virtualizer.scrollOffset` instead.\n\n## Performance Metrics\nBefore:\n- 236 DOM nodes for sections\n- ~3s initial render on slow devices\n\nAfter:\n- ~13 DOM nodes for sections (10 visible + 3 overscan)\n- \u003c500ms initial render\n- 95% reduction in DOM size\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] TranscriptViewer uses Virtual\n- [ ] Only visible sections render (verify in DevTools)\n- [ ] Scrolling is smooth at 60fps\n- [ ] TOC navigation works\n- [ ] URL hash links work\n- [ ] Reading progress still works\n- [ ] Active section highlighting works\n\n## Files to Modify\n- apps/web/src/components/transcript/TranscriptViewer.tsx\n- apps/web/src/components/transcript/ReadingProgress.tsx (adapt to virtual)\n- apps/web/src/components/transcript/TableOfContents.tsx (scrollToIndex)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-29T23:17:18.733131224-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-29T23:51:38.631954928-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-29T23:51:38.631954928-05:00","close_reason":"Virtualization implemented with useVirtualizer, build and tests pass","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"brenner_bot-90k","depends_on_id":"brenner_bot-1uu","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-29T23:17:47.425211258-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"brenner_bot-976","title":"TanStack Virtual: Virtualize CompareView Dual Panes","description":"# Goal\nVirtualize both panes of the distillation comparison view for smooth synchronized scrolling.\n\n## Background\nCompareView displays two distillations side-by-side:\n- Each distillation is 13-38KB of parsed content\n- Users scroll both panes, optionally synchronized\n- Current implementation renders all content in both panes\n\n## Current Implementation\n```typescript\n// CompareView.tsx\n\u003cdiv className=\"grid grid-cols-2 gap-4\"\u003e\n  \u003cScrollPane model={leftModel}\u003e\n    {data.parts.map(part =\u003e (\n      \u003cPart key={part.number} {...part} /\u003e\n    ))}\n  \u003c/ScrollPane\u003e\n  \u003cScrollPane model={rightModel}\u003e\n    {data.parts.map(part =\u003e (\n      \u003cPart key={part.number} {...part} /\u003e\n    ))}\n  \u003c/ScrollPane\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n## Challenges Specific to Compare View\n\n### 1. Synchronized Scrolling\nWhen syncScroll is enabled, both panes scroll together.\nVirtual complicates this because:\n- Items may have different heights in each pane\n- Need to sync by content position, not pixel offset\n\nSolution approach:\n```typescript\n// Sync by percentage, not pixels\nconst leftPercent = leftVirtualizer.scrollOffset / leftVirtualizer.getTotalSize();\nrightVirtualizer.scrollToOffset(leftPercent * rightVirtualizer.getTotalSize());\n```\n\n### 2. Different Content Lengths\nOpus distillation: ~38KB\nGPT distillation: ~26KB  \nGemini distillation: ~13KB\n\nPanes have different total heights. Sync should handle this gracefully.\n\n### 3. Scroll Position per Model\nRemember scroll position for each model selection.\nWhen user switches from Opus to GPT, restore GPT's last position.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Create virtualized pane component\n```typescript\nfunction VirtualizedPane({ model, data, scrollRef }) {\n  const virtualizer = useVirtualizer({\n    count: data.sections.length,\n    getScrollElement: () =\u003e scrollRef.current,\n    estimateSize: () =\u003e 300,\n  });\n  \n  // Expose virtualizer for sync\n  useImperativeHandle(ref, () =\u003e ({\n    scrollToOffset: virtualizer.scrollToOffset,\n    scrollOffset: virtualizer.scrollOffset,\n    totalSize: virtualizer.getTotalSize(),\n  }));\n  \n  return (/* virtual list */);\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement sync controller\n```typescript\nfunction useSyncScroll(leftRef, rightRef, enabled) {\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    if (!enabled) return;\n    \n    const handleLeftScroll = () =\u003e {\n      const percent = leftRef.current.scrollOffset / leftRef.current.totalSize;\n      rightRef.current.scrollToOffset(percent * rightRef.current.totalSize);\n    };\n    \n    // Attach scroll listeners, debounce, etc.\n  }, [enabled]);\n}\n```\n\n## Considerations\n\n### Mobile View\nOn mobile, only one pane shows at a time (tabs).\nVirtualization still helps but sync doesn't apply.\n\n### Bookmark/Highlight Sync\nFuture feature: highlight same section in both panes.\nVirtual doesn't block this but design should account for it.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Both panes virtualized\n- [ ] Sync scroll works smoothly\n- [ ] Independent scroll works when sync disabled\n- [ ] Model switching preserves position\n- [ ] Mobile (single pane) still works\n- [ ] Smooth 60fps scrolling\n\n## Files to Modify\n- apps/web/src/components/distillation/CompareView.tsx\n- apps/web/src/components/distillation/VirtualizedPane.tsx (create)\n- apps/web/src/hooks/useSyncScroll.ts (create)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-29T23:17:47.481616393-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-29T23:54:44.21691739-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-29T23:54:44.21691739-05:00","close_reason":"Feature removed - compare view doesn't make sense","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"brenner_bot-976","depends_on_id":"brenner_bot-90k","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-29T23:18:13.6361465-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"brenner_bot-aly1","title":"Spec: External Evidence Import Protocol","description":"# Goal\nDefine the protocol for importing external evidence (papers, datasets, prior experiment results, benchmark data) into Brenner Loop sessions as citable, structured inputs.\n\n## The Gap This Fills\n\nOther agents covered:\n- **Topic corpus ingestion** - PRIMARY sources for a research domain (like Brenner transcripts for the method itself)\n- **Results → DELTA encoding** - How OUR experiment outputs become deltas\n- **Target repository binding** - How sessions connect to codebases\n\n**What nobody covered:** How do EXTERNAL evidence sources enter the system? Specifically:\n\n1. A paper was published last week that refutes hypothesis H2 - how does that enter the session?\n2. A benchmark dataset exists that could serve as a potency check - how do we reference it?\n3. A colleague ran an experiment outside this system and has results - how do we import them?\n4. A prior Brenner Loop session (different project) produced relevant findings - how do we cite it?\n\nThis is different from \"topic corpus\" because:\n- Topic corpus = domain knowledge you READ to inform hypotheses\n- External evidence = RESULTS that validate/refute hypotheses\n\n## Why This Matters for Real Science\n\nReal research constantly references external evidence:\n- \"Smith et al. (2024) showed X, which supports H1\"\n- \"The ImageNet benchmark demonstrates Y\"\n- \"Our collaborators experiment found Z\"\n\nWithout a formal import mechanism, agents can only:\n1. Reference their training data (not auditable, may be stale)\n2. Hallucinate citations (dangerous)\n3. Ignore external evidence entirely (limiting)\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. Evidence Types\n\n```typescript\ntype EvidenceType = \n  | \"paper\"           // Published research paper\n  | \"preprint\"        // Unpublished manuscript\n  | \"dataset\"         // Structured data (benchmark, corpus, etc.)\n  | \"experiment\"      // Results from an experiment (internal or external)\n  | \"observation\"     // Empirical observation without formal experiment\n  | \"prior_session\"   // Results from another Brenner Loop session\n  | \"expert_opinion\"  // Human expert statement\n  | \"code_artifact\";  // Existing code/implementation as evidence\n```\n\n### 2. Evidence Record Structure\n\n```typescript\ninterface ExternalEvidence {\n  id: string;           // E.g., \"EV-001\" or DOI\n  type: EvidenceType;\n  \n  // Citation info\n  title: string;\n  authors?: string[];\n  date: string;\n  source: string;       // URL, DOI, file path, or session ID\n  \n  // Access\n  access_method: \"url\" | \"file\" | \"agent_mail\" | \"api\";\n  access_path: string;\n  \n  // Content summary\n  abstract?: string;    // Human-readable summary\n  key_findings: string[]; // Bulleted findings relevant to session\n  \n  // Relationship to session\n  imported_at: string;\n  imported_by: string;  // Agent or operator who added it\n  relevance: string;    // Why this evidence matters to this session\n  \n  // Targeting\n  supports?: string[];  // Item IDs this evidence supports (e.g., [\"H1\", \"T3\"])\n  refutes?: string[];   // Item IDs this evidence refutes\n  informs?: string[];   // Item IDs this evidence is relevant to\n  \n  // Verification\n  verified: boolean;    // Has someone confirmed this evidence is real/accurate?\n  verification_notes?: string;\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Import Protocol\n\n#### Via CLI:\n```bash\n# Import a paper by DOI\nbrenner evidence import --type paper --doi \"10.1234/example\" --relevance \"Supports H1 mechanism\"\n\n# Import experiment results from file\nbrenner evidence import --type experiment --file results.json --supports H1,H4 --refutes H2\n\n# Import from prior session\nbrenner evidence import --type prior_session --session \"RS-20251228-initial\" --item H3\n```\n\n#### Via Agent Mail:\n```markdown\nSubject: EVIDENCE: External paper supports H1\n\n```evidence\n{\n  \"type\": \"paper\",\n  \"title\": \"Synaptic vesicle depletion dynamics in attention mechanisms\",\n  \"doi\": \"10.1234/example\",\n  \"key_findings\": [\n    \"RRP depletion follows exponential decay\",\n    \"Recovery time constant ~500ms matches our T1 predictions\"\n  ],\n  \"supports\": [\"H1\"],\n  \"relevance\": \"Provides empirical basis for vesicle depletion timescales\"\n}\n```​\n```\n\n### 4. Evidence in Artifacts\n\nArtifacts gain a new section:\n\n```markdown\n## External Evidence\n\n| ID | Type | Source | Supports | Refutes | Key Finding |\n|----|------|--------|----------|---------|-------------|\n| EV-001 | paper | doi:10.1234/ex | H1 | - | RRP decay matches predictions |\n| EV-002 | dataset | benchmarks/synthetic_rep.json | T5 | - | Provides test stimuli |\n| EV-003 | prior_session | RS-20251228-initial | - | H2 | H2 was killed after T3 |\n```\n\n### 5. Evidence Validation\n\nAgents and operators can challenge evidence:\n- \"Is this paper peer-reviewed?\"\n- \"Is this dataset properly documented?\"\n- \"Can we verify these experiment results?\"\n\nUnverified evidence is marked and treated with lower confidence.\n\n### 6. Integration with Deltas\n\nDeltas can reference evidence:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"operation\": \"KILL\",\n  \"section\": \"hypothesis_slate\",\n  \"target_id\": \"H2\",\n  \"payload\": {\n    \"kill_reason\": \"Contradicted by external evidence EV-001 and EV-003\"\n  },\n  \"evidence_refs\": [\"EV-001\", \"EV-003\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] `ExternalEvidence` type defined in session/artifact types\n- [ ] Evidence section added to artifact schema\n- [ ] CLI `brenner evidence import` command with --type, --source, --supports, --refutes\n- [ ] Agent Mail EVIDENCE: message type with structured payload parsing\n- [ ] Evidence references allowed in delta blocks\n- [ ] Artifact lint validates evidence references (warns on missing EV-xxx)\n- [ ] Web UI shows evidence in session detail\n- [ ] Evidence verification workflow (mark verified/unverified)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Artifact schema (exists)\n- Delta parser (needs extension for evidence_refs)\n- Independent of experiment execution (evidence can be imported without running experiments)\n\n## Non-Goals\n\n- Not building a full citation manager (use Zotero/etc. for that)\n- Not automatically fetching paper content (just referencing)\n- Not implementing evidence strength scoring (thats evaluation rubric territory)\n\n## Example Use Case\n\nResearch question: Does vesicle depletion in bio_inspired_nanochat behave like biological synapses?\n\n1. Operator imports paper on synaptic vesicle dynamics (EV-001)\n2. Operator imports benchmark dataset for repetition detection (EV-002)\n3. Agent references EV-001 in proposing H1 (\"our implementation matches biological timescales\")\n4. Another agent challenges: \"EV-001 was in vitro, not in silico - relevance unclear\"\n5.

We can't:\n- Track which critiques have been addressed\n- Answer \"what's the strongest attack on H1?\"\n- Measure adversarial pressure objectively\n\nFrom §229: \"When they go ugly, kill them\" — but kills should be JUSTIFIED by critiques!\n\n## Schema Design\n\n```typescript\nexport const CritiqueTargetTypeSchema = z.enum([\n  'hypothesis',    // Attacks a specific hypothesis\n  'test',          // Attacks a test design\n  'assumption',    // Attacks an assumption\n  'framing',       // Attacks the research thread itself\n  'methodology',   // Attacks the overall approach\n]);\n\nexport const CritiqueStatusSchema = z.enum([\n  'active',      // Critique not yet addressed\n  'addressed',   // Response provided\n  'dismissed',   // Rejected as invalid\n  'accepted',    // Critique accepted, changes made\n]);\n\nexport const CritiqueSchema = z.object({\n  /** Stable ID: C-{session_id}-{sequence} */\n  id: z.string().regex(/^C-[A-Z0-9]+-\\d{3}$/),\n  \n  /** What type of thing is being attacked? */\n  targetType: CritiqueTargetTypeSchema,\n  \n  /** The ID of what's being attacked (H-xxx, T-xxx, A-xxx, or null for framing) */\n  targetId: z.string().optional(),\n  \n  /** The attack: how could this be fundamentally wrong? */\n  attack: z.string().min(20),\n  \n  /** What evidence would confirm this critique? */\n  evidenceToConfirm: z.string().min(10),\n  \n  /** Does this propose a constructive alternative? */\n  proposedAlternative: z.object({\n    description: z.string(),\n    mechanism: z.string().optional(),\n    testable: z.boolean(),\n  }).optional(),\n  \n  /** Current status */\n  status: CritiqueStatusSchema,\n  \n  /** Response to the critique (if addressed) */\n  response: z.object({\n    text: z.string(),\n    respondedBy: z.string().optional(),\n    respondedAt: z.string().datetime(),\n    actionTaken: z.enum(['none', 'modified', 'killed', 'new_test']).optional(),\n  }).optional(),\n  \n  /** Severity: how serious is this threat? */\n  severity: z.enum(['minor', 'moderate', 'serious', 'critical']),\n  \n  /** Session where this was recorded */\n  sessionId: z.string(),\n  \n  /** Who raised this critique? */\n  raisedBy: z.string().optional(),  // Agent name\n  \n  /** §n transcript anchors if grounded in Brenner */\n  anchors: z.array(z.string()).optional(),\n  \n  /** Timestamps */\n  createdAt: z.string().datetime(),\n  updatedAt: z.string().datetime(),\n});\n```\n\n## Critique Quality Scoring\n\nFrom evaluation rubric:\n\n**Theory Kill Justification (0-3)** — when a KILL is proposed:\n- 0: Kill based on aesthetic preference or convenience\n- 1: Kill based on single piece of weak evidence\n- 2: Kill with multiple evidence points but room for doubt\n- 3: Kill is decisive: direct contradiction, no rescue moves\n\n**Real Third Alternative (0-3)** — critique proposes constructive alternative:\n- 0: Pure skepticism (\"we don't know\")\n- 1: Alternative is vague\n- 2: Specific alternative but not fully developed\n- 3: Concrete alternative with mechanism and testable predictions\n\n## Critique Workflow\n\n```\n1. Adversarial Critic raises critique C1 targeting H1\n     ↓\n2. Critique recorded with attack, evidenceToConfirm, severity\n     ↓\n3. Hypothesis Generator or Test Designer responds\n     ↓\n4. Response recorded, status updated\n     ↓\n5. If accepted: hypothesis modified, killed, or new test designed\n```\n\n## Unaddressed Critiques\n\nUnaddressed critiques WEAKEN the target:\n- A hypothesis with 3 unaddressed critiques is \"under attack\"\n- Dashboard shows \"hypotheses with unaddressed critiques\"\n- Scorecard penalizes unaddressed serious critiques\n\n## CLI Commands\n\n- `brenner critique list [--status=active|addressed|dismissed|accepted] [--target=\u003cid\u003e]`\n- `brenner critique show \u003cid\u003e`\n- `brenner critique create --target=H1 --attack=\"...\" --evidence-to-confirm=\"...\"`\n- `brenner critique respond \u003cid\u003e --response=\"...\" [--action=modified|killed|new_test]`\n- `brenner critique dismiss \u003cid\u003e --reason=\"...\"`\n- `brenner critique accept \u003cid\u003e`\n\n## Integration Points\n\n- **Hypothesis Registry**: Hypotheses gain `linkedCritiques`, `unresolvedCritiqueCount`\n- **Test Binding**: Tests gain `linkedCritiques`\n- **Assumption Registry**: Assumptions gain `linkedCritiques`\n- **Scorecard**: \"Adversarial Pressure\" dimension now has data source\n- **Dashboard**: Show \"hypotheses under attack\" (high unaddressed critique count)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Critique schema defined with all target types\n- [ ] Response tracking with action taken\n- [ ] Severity levels for prioritization\n- [ ] Unaddressed critique flagging\n- [ ] CLI commands for full CRUD + response workflow\n- [ ] Integration with hypotheses, tests, assumptions\n\n## Tasks (to be created)\n\n1.

The system produces artifacts with hypothesis slates, discriminative tests, assumption ledgers, anomaly registers, and adversarial critiques. But there's no infrastructure for:\n\n1. **Tracking hypothesis lifecycle** — A hypothesis born in Session 1 might be refined in Session 3 and killed in Session 7. Currently, hypotheses exist only as disconnected items in artifact files.\n\n2. **Tracking assumptions** — Scale checks and background assumptions are critical but not first-class entities. When an assumption is falsified, which hypotheses are affected?\n\n3. **Tracking anomalies** — Paradoxes and surprising observations drive the method (§103: \"Both could be wrong\"), but they exist only as text.\n\n4. **Tracking critiques** — The Adversarial Critic role produces attacks, but there's no way to track which critiques have been addressed.\n\n5. **Closing the research loop** — Tests are designed but not formally connected to their execution or results.\n\n6. **Method feedback** — The evaluation_rubric_v0.1.md defines 14 scoring criteria, but there's no implementation.\n\n## The Six Registries\n\nThis epic builds **four first-class registries** that map to artifact schema sections:\n\n### 1. Hypothesis Registry\n- Maps to Artifact Schema Section 2: Hypothesis Slate\n- Stable IDs (H-xxx), lifecycle states, cross-session linking\n- Fields: statement, mechanism, confidence, category, anchors, linkedAssumptions, linkedAnomalies\n\n### 2. Assumption Registry (NEW)\n- Maps to Artifact Schema Section 5: Assumption Ledger\n- Types: background, methodological, boundary, scale_physics\n- States: unchecked → challenged → verified/falsified\n- **Key**: Every program MUST have at least one scale_physics assumption (§58: imprisoned imagination)\n- Falsification cascades to dependent hypotheses and tests\n\n### 3. Anomaly Registry (NEW)\n- Maps to Artifact Schema Section 6: Anomaly Register\n- Quarantine status: active → resolved/deferred/paradigm_shifting\n- Conflict tracking: which hypotheses/assumptions does this challenge?\n- **Key**: Anomalies can SPAWN hypotheses (paradox grounding)\n\n### 4. Critique Registry (NEW)\n- Maps to Artifact Schema Section 7: Adversarial Critique\n- Target types: hypothesis, test, assumption, framing\n- Response workflow: active → addressed/dismissed/accepted\n- **Key**: Unaddressed critiques weaken targets; dashboard shows \"hypotheses under attack\"\n\n### 5. Prediction Registry (via Test Binding)\n- Maps to Artifact Schema Section 3: Predictions Table\n- First-class predictions separate from tests\n- Per-hypothesis expected outcomes\n\n### 6. Test Registry (via Test Binding)\n- Maps to Artifact Schema Section 4: Discriminative Tests\n- **MANDATORY**: Potency checks (distinguishes \"no effect\" from \"assay failed\")\n- Evidence-per-week scoring (4 dimensions, 0-12 total)\n- Test→Prediction→Hypothesis binding\n\n## Scorecard: 14-Criterion Evaluation\n\nThe Brenner Method Scorecard aligns with evaluation_rubric_v0.1.md:\n\n**Universal (all roles):**\n1.

{"id":"brenner_bot-mqg7","title":"Feature: Operator Intervention Audit Trail","description":"# Goal\nImplement a formal audit trail for human operator interventions during Brenner Loop sessions, enabling reproducibility, trust verification, and learning from overrides.\n\n## The Gap This Fills\n\nOther agents covered:\n- Human-in-the-loop gates (general concept)\n- Cockpit runner (orchestration)\n- Web UI for sessions\n\n**What nobody covered:** When a human operator overrides an agent decision (e.g., manually killing a hypothesis, forcing a test to be included, editing an artifact before publish), there is no formal record of:\n- WHAT was changed\n- WHO made the change  \n- WHY they made it (rationale)\n- WHEN it happened relative to agent activities\n\nThis matters because:\n1. **Reproducibility** - Can someone else replicate this research if they dont know a human secretly tweaked the artifact?\n2. **Trust** - Was this conclusion reached by agents following the protocol, or did a human push it through?\n3. **Learning** - If operators frequently override a certain agent/role, maybe the role prompt needs improvement.\n4. **Debugging** - When a session goes wrong, was it agent error or operator error?\n\n## Why This Is Different from Deltas\n\nAgent contributions are recorded as DELTA messages with `from: AgentName`. But operator interventions can happen in several ways that bypass the delta flow:\n\n1. **Direct artifact editing** before publish (editing the markdown)\n2. **Selective delta exclusion** (compiling without some deltas)\n3. **Manual message injection** (posting a DELTA on behalf of an agent)\n4. **Override decisions** (\"ignore this critique\", \"force-include this test\")\n5. **Session control actions** (early termination, forced re-run, role reassignment)\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. Operator Intervention Record\n\n```typescript\ninterface OperatorIntervention {\n  id: string;\n  session_id: string;\n  timestamp: string;\n  operator_id: string;  // From BRENNER_AGENT_NAME or \"human\"\n  \n  type: \n    | \"artifact_edit\"      // Direct edit to compiled artifact\n    | \"delta_exclusion\"    // Excluded a delta from compilation\n    | \"delta_injection\"    // Added a delta not from an agent\n    | \"decision_override\"  // Overrode a protocol decision\n    | \"session_control\"    // Terminated, forked, or reset session\n    | \"role_reassignment\"; // Changed agent-role mappings mid-session\n  \n  target: {\n    message_id?: number;   // For delta exclusion/injection\n    artifact_version?: number;\n    item_id?: string;      // Hypothesis, test, etc.\n  };\n  \n  before?: string;  // State before intervention (for diffs)\n  after?: string;   // State after intervention\n  \n  rationale: string;  // Required: WHY did the operator do this?\n  \n  reversible: boolean;\n  reversed_at?: string;\n  reversed_by?: string;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Intervention Capture Points\n\n| Action | Capture Point | Implementation |\n|--------|---------------|----------------|\n| Edit artifact before publish | Compare pre/post in publish action | API route adds intervention record |\n| Exclude delta | Compile action with exclusion list | Track excluded message_ids |\n| Manual delta | DELTA message where from = operator | Check if sender matches known agent roster |\n| Early termination | Session close action | Add \"session_control\" record |\n| Role reassignment | Roster change mid-session | Compare before/after roster state |\n\n### 3. Storage and Access\n\n**Storage:** Interventions stored as part of session metadata in Agent Mail thread (as INFO: messages with structured payload) or in a separate interventions log.\n\n**Access:**\n- `brenner session interventions \u003cthreadId\u003e` - List all interventions\n- Session detail page shows intervention count and expandable list\n- Compiled artifacts include intervention summary in metadata\n\n### 4. Intervention Severity Levels\n\n```\nMINOR: Typo fixes, formatting adjustments\nMODERATE: Delta exclusion, small edits\nMAJOR: Killing hypotheses, adding tests, role changes\nCRITICAL: Session termination, protocol bypass\n```\n\nMajor/Critical interventions trigger warnings in the UI.\n\n### 5. Reproducibility Mode\n\nA \"strict\" compilation mode that:\n- Fails if any MAJOR+ interventions exist\n- Produces a \"clean\" artifact that is purely agent-derived\n- Useful for comparing \"what would agents have produced alone?\"\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] `OperatorIntervention` type defined in session types\n- [ ] Publish action detects and records artifact edits\n- [ ] Compile action accepts `excludeDeltas` param and records exclusions\n- [ ] Manual delta detection (sender not in agent roster)\n- [ ] CLI `brenner session interventions \u003cthreadId\u003e` command\n- [ ] Web session detail shows intervention badge/list\n- [ ] All interventions require `rationale` field\n- [ ] Compiled artifact metadata includes `intervention_count`\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Agent roster (brenner_bot-5so.12.1.x) - needed to detect \"operator vs agent\"\n- Session compile/publish actions (already exist)\n\n## Non-Goals\n\n- Not preventing interventions (operators should have full control)\n- Not implementing approval workflows (thats for future governance)\n- Not tracking every click/action (only meaningful interventions)\n\n## Background: Why This Matters for Science\n\nReal science has lab notebooks that record everything, including mistakes and corrections. The audit trail is the digital equivalent. Without it, a \"research result\" from a Brenner Loop session cannot be trusted or replicated by others.\n\nThe Brenner Method emphasizes transparency and honesty about what was done and why. Occams Broom (hiding inconvenient facts) is an anti-pattern. The audit trail ensures operator interventions are visible, not swept under the rug.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-30T19:01:31.405372314-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-30T22:43:36.737347608-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"brenner_bot-mqg7","depends_on_id":"brenner_bot-jcuz","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-30T22:38:22.90910216-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

The scorecard must align with the actual rubric.\n\n## Rubric Alignment\n\n### Universal Criteria (All Contributions)\n| # | Criterion | Points | What It Measures |\n|---|-----------|--------|------------------|\n| 1 | Structural Correctness | 0-3 | Delta format compliance |\n| 2 | Citation Compliance | 0-3 | §n anchors, [inference] markers |\n| 3 | Rationale Quality | 0-3 | Explains why, which operators |\n\n### Hypothesis Generator (Codex) Criteria\n| # | Criterion | Points | What It Measures |\n|---|-----------|--------|------------------|\n| 4 | Level Separation | 0-3 | ⊘ operator, no conflation |\n| 5 | Third Alternative Presence | 0-3 | Genuine third option |\n| 6 | Paradox Exploitation | 0-2 | Uses anomalies productively |\n\n### Test Designer (Opus) Criteria\n| # | Criterion | Points | What It Measures |\n|---|-----------|--------|------------------|\n| 7 | Discriminative Power | 0-3 | Tests distinguish hypotheses |\n| 8 | Potency Check Sufficiency | 0-3 | Can detect assay failure |\n| 9 | Object Transposition | 0-2 | Alternative systems considered |\n| 10 | Score Calibration Honesty | 0-2 | Conservative, not inflated |\n\n### Adversarial Critic (Gemini) Criteria\n| # | Criterion | Points | What It Measures |\n|---|-----------|--------|------------------|\n| 11 | Scale Check Rigor | 0-3 | Physics calculations, not hand-waves |\n| 12 | Anomaly Quarantine Discipline | 0-3 | Tracking, not sweeping |\n| 13 | Theory Kill Justification | 0-3 | Kills are evidenced |\n| 14 | Real Third Alternative | 0-3 | Constructive, not just skeptical |\n\n## Data Sources\n\nNow that we have all registries, each dimension has a proper data source:\n\n| Criterion | Data Source |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| Citation Compliance | Hypothesis.anchors, Test.anchors (from registries) |\n| Level Separation | Hypothesis.mechanism validation |\n| Third Alternative Presence | Count of hypotheses with category='third_alternative' |\n| Paradox Exploitation | Anomaly Registry: anomalies that spawned hypotheses |\n| Discriminative Power | Test predictions: are outcomes different? |\n| Potency Check Sufficiency | Test.potencyCheck presence and completeness |\n| Scale Check Rigor | Assumption Registry: count and quality of scale_physics assumptions |\n| Anomaly Quarantine Discipline | Anomaly Registry: status tracking |\n| Theory Kill Justification | Critique→Kill linkage in transitions |\n| Real Third Alternative | Critique.proposedAlternative with testable=true |\n\n## Per-Contribution Scoring\n\nFrom rubric, weighted composite per role:\n\n**Hypothesis Generator (Codex):**\n```\nScore = (Structural × 1.0) + (Citation × 1.0) + (Rationale × 0.5) +\n        (Level-Sep × 1.5) + (Third-Alt × 2.0) + (Paradox × 0.5)\nMax = 19 points\n```\n\n**Test Designer (Opus):**\n```\nScore = (Structural × 1.0) + (Citation × 1.0) + (Rationale × 0.5) +\n        (Discriminative × 2.0) + (Potency × 2.0) + (Object-Trans × 0.5) + (Calibration × 0.5)\nMax = 21.5 points\n```\n\n**Adversarial Critic (Gemini):**\n```\nScore = (Structural × 1.0) + (Citation × 1.0) + (Rationale × 0.5) +\n        (Scale × 1.5) + (Quarantine × 1.5) + [Kill-Justify × 1.5]* + (Real-Third × 1.5)\nMax (with KILL) = 25.5 points\nMax (ADD/EDIT) = 21 points\n```\n\n## Session-Level Aggregation\n\nFor evaluating a complete session:\n\n1. **Volume**: Count of valid contributions per role\n2. **Quality**: Mean composite score per role\n3. **Progression**: Did quality improve over rounds?\n4. **Convergence**: Did hypotheses narrow (kills \u003e adds by end)?\n5. **Coverage**: Were all operators in the role's toolkit used?\n\n## Pass/Fail Gates\n\nCertain failures are automatic disqualifiers:\n\n| Failure | Consequence |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Invalid JSON in delta | Delta rejected |\n| Missing potency check | Test rejected |\n| Fake transcript anchor | Contribution flagged |\n| KILL without rationale | KILL rejected |\n| Third alternative missing | Hypothesis set incomplete |\n\n## Warning Thresholds\n\n| Condition | Warning |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Composite \u003c 50% of max | Low-quality contribution |\n| \u003e 3 ADDs without KILL | Possible hypothesis sprawl |\n| Scale check missing for mechanism claim | Unverified claim |\n| Potency score \u003c 2 | Weak assay design |\n\n## Feedback Generation\n\nFor each low-scoring dimension, generate specific feedback:\n\n**Example for Level Separation (scored 1/3):**\n```\n[WARNING] Level Separation (1/3)\n  Issue: Hypothesis mechanism shows level conflation\n  Found: \"The gene tells the cell to differentiate\" (H-RS20251230-001)\n  Problem: This anthropomorphizes genes with agency\n  \n  Suggestion: Reframe as mechanism: \"Gene X expression enables \n  transcription of differentiation factors\"\n  \n  Sydney Brenner says: \"Programs don't have wants. Interpreters do.\" (§58)\n```\n\n## CLI Commands\n\n- `brenner score \u003csession-id\u003e` — Score session with all 14 criteria\n- `brenner score contribution \u003cdelta-id\u003e` — Score single contribution\n- `brenner feedback \u003csession-id\u003e` — Detailed feedback per dimension\n- `brenner validate \u003csession-id\u003e` — Check pass/fail gates only\n- `brenner score --program=\u003cid\u003e` — Aggregate across program sessions\n\n## Integration Points\n\n- **Hypothesis Registry**: Validates mechanism, anchors, category\n- **Assumption Registry**: Validates scale_physics presence/quality\n- **Anomaly Registry**: Validates quarantine discipline\n- **Critique Registry**: Validates kill justification\n- **Test Binding**: Validates discriminative power, potency\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] All 14 criteria from rubric implemented\n- [ ] Per-role weighted composites match rubric\n- [ ] Data sources connected to registries\n- [ ] Pass/fail gates enforced\n- [ ] Warning thresholds generate alerts\n- [ ] Brenner quotes integrated into feedback\n- [ ] Session-level aggregation working\n\n## Related Specs\n- specs/evaluation_rubric_v0.1.md — The authoritative source","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-30T19:41:45.805584341-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-30T22:43:36.738429814-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"brenner_bot-nihv","depends_on_id":"brenner_bot-6n4e","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-30T19:42:04.186796721-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"brenner_bot-nihv","depends_on_id":"brenner_bot-m6yw","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-30T19:42:04.219302717-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"brenner_bot-nihv","depends_on_id":"brenner_bot-5kr7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-30T20:05:55.568354717-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"brenner_bot-nihv","depends_on_id":"brenner_bot-vxd3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-30T20:05:55.600017521-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"brenner_bot-nihv","depends_on_id":"brenner_bot-f5wy","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-30T20:05:55.630890879-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"brenner_bot-nihv","depends_on_id":"brenner_bot-jcuz","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-30T22:38:07.686497867-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"brenner_bot-ox3","title":"EPIC: Brenner Jargon \u0026 Glossary System (tooltips + glossary page)","description":"# Brenner Jargon \u0026 Glossary System\n\n## Overview\nImplement a comprehensive jargon/glossary system that makes technical terms accessible to newcomers without boring experienced users. Inspired by the agentic_coding_flywheel_setup implementation but adapted to BrennerBot's design system and domain.\n\n## The Problem\nBrennerBot contains extensive technical vocabulary across multiple domains:\n- **Brenner-specific operators** (⊘ Level-split, 𝓛 Recode, etc.)\n- **Scientific methodology** (decision experiments, forbidden patterns)\n- **Biology/genetics** (C. elegans, DNA, genetic code)\n- **Bayesian reasoning** (likelihood ratio, prior/posterior)\n- **Project terminology** (Agent Mail, beads, corpus)\n\nA \"normal educated person\" unfamiliar with molecular biology, Brenner's work, or Bayesian statistics will encounter hundreds of terms they don't understand. This creates a barrier to entry and limits the project's accessibility.\n\n## The Solution\nA two-part system:\n\n### 1. Inline Jargon Component (`\u003cJargon\u003e`)\n- **Desktop**: Hover triggers tooltip with short definition, \"Think of it like...\" analogy, and link to glossary\n- **Mobile**: Tap triggers bottom sheet with full definition, why-we-use-it, and related terms\n- **Styling**: Subtle dotted underline (matches brennerbot design system's primary/30 color)\n- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA, focus management, keyboard navigation\n\n### 2. Glossary Page (`/glossary`)\n- Searchable full-text index of all terms\n- Category filtering (operators, biology, methodology, etc.)\n- Deep linking via hash (#machine-language)\n- Expandable detail cards with:\n  - Short one-liner\n  - Full explanation in plain language\n  - \"Think of it like...\" analogy\n  - \"Why we use it\" context\n  - Related terms with links\n\n## Design Constraints\n- Must match existing BrennerBot design system (Stripe/Apple/Linear inspired)\n- Use existing Tailwind tokens: `primary`, `accent`, `muted-foreground`, `rounded-xl`, etc.\n- No external animation libraries (use existing CSS keyframes from globals.css)\n- Mobile-first responsive design\n- Support reduced-motion preferences\n- NO MOCKS in tests - test with real glossary data\n\n## Term Categories\n1. **Brenner Operators** (14): ⊘ ⊕ ◊ 𝓛 ≡ ✂ ⟂ ↑ ΔE ∿ † ⌂ 🔧 ⊞\n2. **Core Brenner Concepts** (6): Brenner move, decision experiment, digital handle, etc.\n3. **Extended Brenner Vocabulary** (17): Abundance trick, Gedanken organism, Occam's broom, etc.\n4. **Scientific Biology** (20+): DNA, RNA, C. elegans, genetic code, mutagenesis, etc.\n5. **Bayesian/Statistical** (10+): Prior, posterior, likelihood ratio, KL divergence, etc.\n6. **Scientific Method** (10+): Hypothesis, falsification, paradigm, control, etc.\n7. **Project-Specific** (10+): Agent Mail, beads, corpus, kickoff, thread protocol, etc.\n\n## Reference Implementation\nAnalyzed from github.com/Dicklesworthstone/agentic_coding_flywheel_setup:\n- `lib/jargon.ts`: JargonTerm interface + dictionary\n- `components/jargon.tsx`: Jargon component with portal tooltips\n- `app/glossary/page.tsx`: Full glossary page with search/filter\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Any dotted-underline term can be hovered/tapped to learn its meaning\n- Glossary is discoverable via navigation and tooltip links\n- First-time users can understand content without external research\n- Expert users are not annoyed by the glossary system\n- All terms are accurate and grounded in project documentation","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-30T00:56:16.505719259-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-30T01:27:54.789921827-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-30T01:27:54.789921827-05:00","close_reason":"EPIC COMPLETE: Brenner Jargon \u0026 Glossary System fully implemented. 105 terms across 6 categories, Jargon component with tooltips/sheets, /glossary page with search/filter/deep-link, 66+ tests covering all functionality.","labels":["accessibility","glossary","ux"]}

{"id":"brenner_bot-prmc","title":"Spec: Cross-Session Artifact Linking (Research Program Continuity)","description":"# Goal\nDefine the formal mechanism for linking artifacts across sessions to enable \"research programs\" that span multiple Brenner Loop sessions over time.\n\n## The Gap This Fills\n\nOther agents covered:\n- Target Repository Binding (how sessions bind to codebases)\n- Results → DELTA Encoding (how experiment outputs become deltas)\n- Agent Roster (how agents get roles)\n\n**What nobody covered:** When Session 2 builds on a hypothesis from Session 1, there is no formal linking mechanism. You cannot say \"H2 in this session extends/refines brenner_bot-session-001:H3\". Research programs are inherently multi-session, but the artifact format treats each session as isolated.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n1. **Hypothesis Genealogy** - Track how ideas evolve across sessions. Did H4 in Session 3 come from refining H2 in Session 1 after T3 failed?\n\n2. **Research Continuity** - When you resume research after days/weeks, you need to understand \"where did we leave off?\" and \"what prior art exists?\"\n\n3. **Credit Attribution** - Which session/agent first proposed an idea that later proved correct?\n\n4. **Avoiding Duplicate Work** - Without cross-session search, agents might re-propose killed hypotheses or re-design already-run tests.\n\n5. **Research Program Management** - A \"research program\" (e.g., \"bio_inspired_nanochat vesicle investigation\") may span 5+ sessions. Need to track progress at the program level.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. Artifact Cross-Reference Syntax\n\nAdd a `references` field to artifact items that can point to other sessions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"operation\": \"ADD\",\n  \"section\": \"hypothesis_slate\",\n  \"payload\": {\n    \"name\": \"Refined vesicle hypothesis\",\n    \"claim\": \"...\",\n    \"references\": [\n      { \"session\": \"RS-20251230-bio-rrp\", \"item\": \"H2\", \"relation\": \"refines\" },\n      { \"session\": \"RS-20251228-initial\", \"item\": \"T3\", \"relation\": \"informed_by\" }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Reference Relation Types\n\n- `extends` - This item builds on the referenced item\n- `refines` - This item is a more precise version\n- `refutes` - This item contradicts the referenced item  \n- `informed_by` - This item was influenced by (looser coupling)\n- `supersedes` - This item replaces the referenced item\n- `replicates` - This item re-tests the referenced item\n\n### 3. Research Program Metadata\n\nAdd a top-level `research_program` field to artifacts:\n\n```yaml\nresearch_program:\n  id: \"bio-nanochat-rrp-investigation\"\n  name: \"Bio-Inspired Nanochat RRP Investigation\"\n  sessions:\n    - RS-20251228-initial\n    - RS-20251230-bio-rrp\n    - RS-20251231-followup\n  current_session: RS-20251231-followup\n  status: active\n```\n\n### 4. Cross-Session Search Index\n\nExtend the artifact catalog (when built) to support queries like:\n- \"Find all hypotheses that reference H2 from session X\"\n- \"Show the evolution of this hypothesis across sessions\"\n- \"List all sessions in research program Y\"\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] `references` field added to delta schema (delta_output_format_v0.1.md)\n- [ ] Reference relation types documented with examples\n- [ ] Artifact merge validates reference syntax\n- [ ] Lint warns on broken cross-session references (referenced session/item not found)\n- [ ] Research program metadata schema defined\n- [ ] CLI/web can query cross-session references (depends on artifact catalog)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- This depends on having an artifact catalog/index (not yet beaded by others)\n- Blocking: Nothing directly, but enables research program management\n\n## Non-Goals\n\n- Not building the full catalog search here (that is a separate bead)\n- Not building a UI for visualizing hypothesis genealogy (future work)\n- Not enforcing references (they remain optional annotations)\n\n## Background: Why Sessions Are Currently Isolated\n\nThe current artifact format (artifact_schema_v0.1.md) has `metadata.session_id` but no mechanism for one artifact to reference another. Each session produces a standalone artifact. This was fine for single-session pilots but breaks down when research spans multiple sessions.\n\nThe Brenner Method emphasizes building on prior work (\"stand on the shoulders of giants\") - we need infrastructure that supports this at the session level.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-30T19:00:03.271284703-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-30T22:43:36.741230654-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"brenner_bot-prmc","depends_on_id":"brenner_bot-jcuz","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-30T22:38:17.835895845-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Fixed height cards with text truncation (simpler)\n2. Dynamic measurement (more complex but better UX)\n\nRecommendation: Start with fixed height, iterate if needed.\n\n### Filter Changes\nWhen filter/search changes, result set changes entirely.\n- Reset scroll to top\n- Recalculate virtual list\n\n### Empty State\nWhen no quotes match filter, show \"No results\" message.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Quote grid virtualized\n- [ ] Responsive columns work\n- [ ] Filter changes handled smoothly\n- [ ] Scroll is smooth at 60fps\n- [ ] Empty state works\n- [ ] Tag filtering still works\n\n## Files to Modify\n- apps/web/src/components/quotebank/QuoteBankViewer.tsx\n- apps/web/src/components/quotebank/VirtualizedQuoteGrid.tsx (create)\n- apps/web/src/components/quotebank/QuoteCard.tsx (ensure fixed height)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-29T23:18:13.679947704-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-30T00:43:57.170223089-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-30T00:43:57.170223089-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented TanStack Virtual for QuoteBankViewer: added useVirtualizer with dynamic height measurement, overscan, and proper scroll container.

API Timeout Errors\n- Slow API response (\u003e5s)\n- Complete timeout (\u003e30s)\n- Partial response followed by timeout\n- Retry behavior after timeout\n\n## 3. Network Disconnection\n- Loss of connectivity mid-operation\n- Offline indicator display\n- Queue pending actions\n- Recovery when connection restored\n\n## 4. Authentication Errors\n- Session expiry during operation\n- Token refresh failure\n- Redirect to login\n- Return to original page after re-auth\n\n## 5. Server Errors\n- 500 Internal Server Error\n- 502 Bad Gateway\n- 503 Service Unavailable\n- Error message display\n- Retry suggestions\n\n## 6. Rate Limiting\n- 429 Too Many Requests\n- Backoff display\n- Countdown timer\n- Automatic retry after cooldown\n\n# Test File Structure\n```typescript\n// e2e/error-handling.spec.ts\nimport { test,

Data is re-fetched on every navigation\n2. No caching between page visits\n3. Server must parse on every request\n\n## Migration Strategy\n\n### Option A: Keep Server Fetch + Hydrate (Recommended)\nServer Component prefetches, passes to client via HydrationBoundary.\n- Best for SEO (content in initial HTML)\n- Best for performance (no client-side loading flash)\n- Query still provides caching for subsequent navigations\n\n### Option B: Full Client-Side Fetch\nRemove server prefetch, let Query handle everything.\n- Simpler code\n- Shows loading state on first visit\n- Worse SEO\n\n**We choose Option A** because the corpus pages are content-heavy and benefit from SSR.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Update corpus/[doc]/page.tsx\n```typescript\nimport { HydrationBoundary, QueryClient, dehydrate } from '@tanstack/react-query';\n\nexport default async function CorpusDocPage({ params }) {\n  const queryClient = new QueryClient();\n  \n  await queryClient.prefetchQuery({\n    queryKey: ['corpus', 'doc', params.doc],\n    queryFn: () =\u003e readCorpusDoc(params.doc),\n  });\n\n  return (\n    \u003cHydrationBoundary state={dehydrate(queryClient)}\u003e\n      \u003cDocumentViewer docId={params.doc} /\u003e\n    \u003c/HydrationBoundary\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Update TranscriptViewer\n```typescript\nexport function TranscriptViewer({ docId }: { docId: string }) {\n  const { data, isLoading, error } = useCorpusDoc(docId);\n  \n  if (isLoading) return \u003cTranscriptSkeleton /\u003e;\n  if (error) return \u003cErrorBoundary error={error} /\u003e;\n  \n  // ... rest of component\n}\n```\n\n### 3.

Create table instance\n```typescript\nconst table = useReactTable({\n  data: CROSSWALK_DATA,\n  columns,\n  getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),\n  getSortedRowModel: getSortedRowModel(),\n  state: { sorting },\n  onSortingChange: setSorting,\n});\n```\n\n### 3. Render with Table primitives\n```typescript\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    {table.getHeaderGroups().map(headerGroup =\u003e (\n      \u003ctr key={headerGroup.id}\u003e\n        {headerGroup.headers.map(header =\u003e (\n          \u003cth \n            key={header.id}\n            onClick={header.column.getToggleSortingHandler()}\n            className=\"cursor-pointer\"\n          \u003e\n            {flexRender(header.column.columnDef.header, header.getContext())}\n            {{\n              asc: ' ↑',\n              desc: ' ↓',\n            }[header.column.getIsSorted() as string] ?? null}\n          \u003c/th\u003e\n        ))}\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n    ))}\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    {table.getRowModel().rows.map(row =\u003e (\n      \u003ctr key={row.id}\u003e\n        {row.getVisibleCells().map(cell =\u003e (\n          \u003ctd key={cell.id}\u003e\n            {flexRender(cell.column.columnDef.cell, cell.getContext())}\n          \u003c/td\u003e\n        ))}\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n    ))}\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n```\n\n## Enhancements Over Current\n\n### Sorting\nClick any column header to sort:\n- Alphabetical by concept\n- Alphabetical by model interpretation\n\n### Column Visibility (Optional)\nAdd toggles to show/hide specific models.\nUseful for focused comparison.\n\n### Cell Click to Navigate\nMake cells clickable to navigate to that model's full distillation.\n\n### Keyboard Navigation\n- Arrow keys to move between cells\n- Enter to activate cell link\n- Tab for focus management\n\n## Considerations\n\n### Styling\nKeep the existing model-specific color coding.\nTable primitives are unstyled - apply existing Tailwind classes.\n\n### Mobile\nOn mobile, table may need horizontal scroll.\nConsider: Card view on mobile, table on desktop.\n\n### Row Hover\nMaintain existing row hover highlight.\nTable provides row.getIsSelected() etc. for states.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Table uses TanStack Table\n- [ ] Column sorting works\n- [ ] Keyboard navigation works\n- [ ] Existing styling preserved\n- [ ] Model badges in headers\n- [ ] Cell links to distillations work\n\n## Files to Modify\n- apps/web/src/components/distillation/CrosswalkTable.tsx","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-29T23:18:45.917373474-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-29T23:55:45.850919825-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-29T23:55:45.850919825-05:00","close_reason":"Upgraded CrosswalkTable to use TanStack Table with column sorting, keyboard navigation (Enter/Space), ARIA attributes (role=grid, aria-sort), and sort indicators.

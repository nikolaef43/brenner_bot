Cross-referencing between distillations\n\n## Goals\n\n1. **Visual Polish**: Every pixel intentional, consistent spacing, refined micro-interactions\n2. **Reading Experience**: Optimize for long-form content consumption on small screens\n3. **Performance**: 60fps animations, no layout shifts, instant interactions\n4. **Gesture Support**: Natural swipe navigation, pull-to-refresh where appropriate\n5. **Accessibility**: Works perfectly with VoiceOver/TalkBack, proper contrast ratios\n\n## Anti-Goals\n\n- NOT building a native app (this is web optimization)\n- NOT adding offline-first PWA features (separate epic if needed)\n- NOT redesigning the desktop experience\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- Lighthouse mobile performance score \u003e 95\n- No layout shift (CLS = 0)\n- Touch interactions feel 'native'\n- User feedback: 'feels like a native app'\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n- Framework: Next.js 16.10 + React 19 (App Router)\n- Styling: Tailwind v4 with existing design system\n- Testing: Playwright for E2E, manual device testing\n- Key breakpoints: sm(640), md(768), lg(1024)\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis epic has no external blockers but benefits from:\n- Testing infrastructure for visual regression testing","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-29T22:25:46.811069444-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-29T22:25:46.811069444-05:00"}

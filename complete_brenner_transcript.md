## 1. Coming from Eastern European stock

> Both my parents had come to South Africa from Russia. My father came from Lithuania, and he came to South Africa in 1910. It was a matter of sheer luck that he didn't go to America, 'cause he had a sister in America and his brother was in South Africa – his older brother – and when he got to London, he only had enough money for the boat to Cape Town, which was half the fare to New York, so he took that.
>
> His brother, who is someone I remembered very well, was much older than him and had come to South Africa about 20 years before that and was... had served in the Tzar's army in the Crimea in about 1870, 1880. And my father actually left to escape conscription to the army, which is most people... which is what the fate of most people was.
>
> My mother came to South Africa in 1922. She came from Latvia; she came from a town called Dvinsk; so she had lived through the entire period of the war and the revolution. My grandfather was an old Bolshevik who had left Russia in... prior to this, about 1907, and of course the family lived throughout the... the war and so on.
>
> My father actually left a brother in Russia and he and his family died of the famine in 1923 in a town called... which was then called Ekatrinograd *[sic]* and I think is now called Ekatrinograd *[sic]* again, but I believe it got changed to Gorky in the meantime, however – one of those things – so... and this... people had come to South Africa and my father had settled in a town just outside Johannesburg called **Germiston** where I was born.
>
> My father was a shoe repairer – cobbler – and we lived in a... two rooms at the back of his shop, as many people lived in those days. Next door was a... a plumber who'd also come from Eastern Europe, and they also lived in the back of the shop, but they... they advanced economically much more rapidly than we did.

---

## 2. Mother and father

> Well, my father was a shoemaker and not a well-educated man; he couldn't read or write at all, I mean, till the day he died. He had a great aptitude for languages and so he learnt and spoke two African languages: Afrikaans...

*[Q] But he couldn't read or write?*

> Could not read or write. My mother taught herself to read and write, so she was the only one who could speak English. In fact, when my father finally had to get naturalised, because, you know, none of this... we had to get a lawyer to get the forms filled out because he couldn't read or write, so that was the... that was his background.

*[Q] Was he a shoemaker till the end of his life?*

> Yes, yes, right till the very end, he went on working till he was over 80; wouldn't give it up. Everybody said, 'It's ridiculous', but he still had his little shop and went on doing this because... one of the people who felt that if you stopped work, you... you might as well just stop living.

*[Q] What did he feel about your science?*

> Well, he... you know, he didn't understand it, but he could understand why I was doing it; let's put it this way... and of course my mother never forgave me for not becoming a specialist – you know a doctor – but... but of course never tried to stop me basically. Well, I suppose they couldn't have done it anyway. So that was...

*[Q] Did your mother ever work?*

> No, my mother was always at home, you know, and looked after... looked after this... looked after the family and of course from a completely different... I mean, all that I... I can remember was, you know the great... the stories I used to hear about what it was like to be in Russia between, say, 1914 and 1922 – whenever she got out, you know – and there's these terrible stories of their... of this town which there were, you know, Red Latvians and White Latvians and Red Russians and White Russians; it exchanged hands almost every time.
>
> And the story I do remember being told as a young child was a story of one being sent to get bread and standing in line and finally getting half a loaf of bread, but by the time this... this child had walked home with this bread, had... by taking a little bit, had eaten the entire loaf, and the family waiting for this bread got nothing; it was empty. But, you know, one learnt about food being made with potato peelings but... and of course to... to hear all of this in... in Germiston; things that were going on was like getting news from an alien planet. I mean, first of all there was never any snow, so the concept of what was it like to live through a really hard north, northern winter, this just had no connection with us, so... and I think the kind of picture that you draw of the world from stories or from what you read is so false that, you know, one... one can never grasp it when one sees it in reality again that one's image of it was so wrong.

*[Q] Were they religious?*

> My mother was fairly orthodox; my father was a total agnostic. He didn't... he didn't practice anything and was against it all. My mother was of course... practised everything, and of course for a long time we had my grandmother living with us who spoke no English and spoke Russian and Yiddish only. So I learnt as a child to speak some Russian, because it was quite interesting. One always knew that when the parents and the grandmother spoke Russian, this was something they didn't want us to hear, so it became very important to try and find out what it was. So it was that kind of background.

## 3. Where did the insult 'Peruvian Jew' come from

> I think that to try and understand what the whole of this culture, or this immigrant culture in Johannesburg, was... it can be very easily illustrated by an original piece of sociological research that I conducted after I came to England. I was... met some people who said they'd met some nice South Africans who had come from Johannesburg and they were talking about mutual friends of them... of theirs, and the South African said, 'Oh, those Peruvians'. So they said, 'Well, we then went to the other people when we met them and said, "We didn't know you came from Peru", and they got very upset'.
>
> Now, I said to them, 'Don't worry, you know, this is a... this is a term of... of abuse and in fact it means... it's a kind of Jew who is stingy, mean, uneducated, uncultured'. And they said, 'But how... what on earth is the connection with Peru?' So I said, 'Well, look, I don't know, I've never thought about it until now, but I will do some research'.
>
> So I went and did research and the long story can be cut short. The following is the true origins of this word, because it was clear it was impossible for 90% of South African Jews to have come from Peru; that was inconceivable. I then discovered that when the immigrants came, there had been prior to this great movement at the turn of the century – the first 20 years – there had been a much earlier immigration of Jews from... largely from Germany, who of course were financiers and, incidentally, the same history is the same as the one in America. Namely the earlier immigrants, the Lehmans and so on, who'd come from Germany, were succeeded later by the East European ones.
>
> The people who had come from Eastern Europe decided to form an organisation which was called in Yiddish the **Polnischer und Russischer Yiddische Verein**, abbreviated to **PERUV** – Polnischer und Russischer Yiddische Verein. PERUV. And the people who attended this club came to be called *Peruvnics*, which fits, but later this had become anglicised, as indeed you know; Simon turned into Seymour, and, you know, all the names that come... and so they were called Peruvians. It was a much more gentile... hence the origin of the word Peruvian Jew. It only has... nothing to do with Peru but with origins in Eastern Europe and reflects exactly the age-old disdain that the German Jews had felt for the Eastern European immigrants – the Eastern European co-religionists.
>
> And that was that story, then, and... and of course it was amazing to me in later life to find that the same cultural thing had been gone through in exactly the same way in... in America. Later, when I got to know Ed Shils very well and went to visit with him in Chicago, exactly the same kind of history took place in Chicago between the earlier immigrants and the later people from Eastern Europe, who did that.

## 4. Early memories of living in a shop

> We had lived in the back of the shop, and I have this memory of playing on the floor, and still can remember the smell of leather that dominates my entire early life.

*[Q] Were you an only child, Sydney?*

> No, I had a sister who... my... my sister was two years younger than me, so she was born much later, and, of course, I should have mentioned, I was born on **13th January 1927**.

---

## 5. Learning to read from the tablecloth

> I learnt to read at a very early age because round the corner from us, again, there was a... a lady whose husband had been a tailor and she had died. But she had known my mother's family from Latvia because they'd all come from the same time – as it was called there, *Landsleute*; that is, all people who originated from the same thing – and I had gone... and I spent quite a lot of time with her. She lived in a tiny room where she cooked for herself, and she taught me to read from the newspapers that were on the table – which of course in lieu of tablecloths – and this is where I learned to read; so that by the age of four, I could read quite fluently.

---

## 6. Accelerated early schooling

> My father had a customer – a lady called Mrs McCartney – and they came into the shop – I must have been about four and a half – and she found me reading, and she said to my father that I should be sent to kindergarten and my father said that he couldn't afford it, but she said she would take me into this kindergarten. This kindergarten was run as part of the Presbyterian Church, in Germiston, and so I started going to kindergarten when I was five years old, and I did the first three years of... I was... very rapidly started... moved into the standard school curriculum, and so I did the first three years of what would be grade school in one year. So I did grade I, grade II and standard I, as they were called in South Africa, in one year, and then I went to the state school, the **Germiston Junior School**, and so I started at the age of six in standard II. So I was very far in advance of my age.

---

## 7. Libraries

> And of course the most interesting thing that I can recall from one of those is of course discovering the public library. A man called **Andrew Carnegie** was a great... a great donor to the world because he gave money to set up public libraries, and Germiston had a public library – the Carnegie it was called – and so getting in there and finding the world of books. So the world of books has always been very important – there were no books at home of course – and I rapidly graduated to the adult library, and of course I read voraciously about lots of things.

---

## 8. The early books that inspired me to do chemistry

> But one of the early books... there are two early books that I read while I went through school which were in the field of science and which I remember very clearly. One was called *The Young Chemist*, and this was a book by a man called Sherwood Taylor, and it gave wonderful recipes for how to do chemistry experiments, and I lost my copy of that unfortunately, but I'd started doing chemistry at the age of 10.
>
> By this time we had changed our houses and had moved into the house in the southern parts of Germiston – so that was 1937 – where there was a garage and which... we didn't have a car, and that's when I started to do chemistry in a serious way. It was very difficult of course to get apparatus and... and this, but I saved my money and bought a test-tube every two weeks or some reagent and of course went to buy these at the pharmacist.
>
> And... so those experiments there which were involved... you know, in making pigments and so on. I started doing biochemistry shortly after that, which was extracting pigments from leaves and petals and so on, and actually discovering that anthocyanin pigments actually responded to pH and, needless to say, that was not an original discovery.

---

## 9. Never more than top six in high school

> In the meantime, I had progressed through school and as... we did not have much choice; we would always pursue a standard curriculum, and the subjects that we did was English, Afrikaans – which was the other language there – Latin, general science, history and mathematics. And that was the standard education if you were going on to more important things. If you weren't going to go to university, then of course you did commercial arithmetic instead of Latin; that was... sometimes was called... I think in my day it was still called bookkeeping but later they called it commercial arithmetic – it just sounded better.
>
> And I think that during my period in high school, I wasn't... I wasn't the sort of top of the class student. I was good, I always got into the first six, but people never pointed to me and said, 'He's going to be the... the winner'. And so I was quite... this... and of course I... when I passed my exams I did get a first class, but I didn't get any distinctions, for example.
>
> Yes, and all the people actually that were thought to be the real winners, who got four distinctions in matric, went on later to a life of total intellectual obscurity and so I think that led me always to the conclusion that even if a student comes to me with a first class degree, he has to prove to me he could have got a second class degree if he'd tried. Because I think that kind of book learning and giving it back in examinations was not my forte.
>
> I think that what... because already I think I'd started to ask questions beyond this, especially in science, I realised that what I was being taught in chemistry and physics and so on was just the... was just what was in the book and what you needed to do to... to pass an examination.
>
> The teachers were not very good, and of course this was at a... you know, in a provincial place in a provincial country in a small school, but, you know, one learnt just the basic elementary paths of chemistry. Mathematics did not take you as far as calculus; it took you as far as the solution of quadratic equations.

## 10. Beaten, bullied and strangled

> School teachers... the... the ones I remember positively is, first of all, Mrs McCartney – the owner of this kindergarten. I remember her. I remember my teacher Miss Stein, from when I first went to the public school, standard... when I was in standard II and for the rest of them... I mean, I have memories of them as being just a completely bunch of cruel... there was a... they were really awful people in my high school who were...
>
> For example they... the boys had... there was a man called Mr Cooij *[sic]*, who said we all had to wear ties – I think from this period stems my total dislike of ties – and if you came to his class without a tie, then what he would do is he would take the... the cords from the skylights, the fan lights, the windows and he would tie this around your neck in such a way that your feet were about a quarter of an inch off the ground, so you either strangled or stood on tiptoe all through the class, so every boy who didn't get a tie was strung up there. So, you know, such things of... like cruelty were pretty standard.
>
> I remember my English teacher who didn't like the way I recited the only poetry that I remembered, which was from King Lear, and is this wonderful speech where Edmund decries the fact that he's a bastard and it's full of words like base, vile, bastard, bastard, which of course was wonderful to enunciate in public and... with the correct tone of voice, and all the boys that crossed his... that crossed him, we would have to crawl into the class and stand – I mean, it's just ridiculous – and be like dogs there, kneel by our chairs until we got permission to sit there. So school wasn't a very stimulating environment and one just...

*[Q] Were you beaten?*

> Yes, we were; we were beaten. We were extremely bullied as well. It was a school with... and all schools there were... and since I was small and two to three years younger than everybody else, I simply grew up to be a professional coward; it's the only thing... that is, I would agree to everything not to get bullied. So, you know... so that is... that is also something that helps you to withdraw and then have fantasies how you can get your revenge on all of these people, but that was the thing... so, in a way, going to university was a tremendous liberation.

---

## 11. Self motivation and independent learning

> Well, of course I had decided that I wanted to be a scientist.

*[Q] Why?*

> Because I thought that it was something that you could actually do, and I should have said that of course the thing that turned me onto biology was the book *The Science of Life* by Wells... Huxley and Wells, I think it is... just G P Wells. And this book, of which I still have the copy, which I have to confess I stole from the public library and told them I lost it because I couldn't get a copy of it at the time, and so I paid the fine which may be... may have been two shillings in those days – that's a lot of money – and that is the book that really turned me on to biology.
>
> Because of course the biology at school, that... the things we learnt were quite simple. You know, they were about beans and how beans grew and so on, and I was always very interested in the experimental part of it. And I had realised in this way that you didn't actually have to ask people to do things; you could just go and do them. If you can get hold of a book that told you... introduced you to how to do it, you could just go and do it.
>
> So that is something I think that I have kept with me all my life because I've never learnt anything from going to courses. If I want to learn a new subject, I get a book and I start doing it. And it's advice I've always gived... I mean, when I got interested in computing in the early '60s, I started by learning an assembly language and actually programming a computer because there's... and I think in today's environment where nobody can learn anything unless they go to a course, or do this in a formal sense, I just never had that since there was no one really to teach me, and so I had cultivated – not cultivated, it had just come, probably out of necessity combined with inclination – just the idea that knowledge is out there; it's available. If you can't buy the book you can always go to the public library and steal it if necessary. So, I think that that is... and I think that's one of the most important things, to become a scientist.

*[Q] Sydney, it seems you were totally self-motivated. There were no friends, no teachers, no parents, nothing.*

> Yes, I mean, you know, I'd fortunately grown up in a culture where learning was quite important. The... the old... the Jewish immigrants into South Africa had come with the old Jewish culture that learning was important and of course if one could divert this learning to become a surgeon or a lawyer that was even better. My mother always said you should never marry a girl because... for her money but it's just as easy to fall in love with a rich girl as it is with a poor girl. So, I mean, there was that kind of culture which never said, 'This is nonsense', and so there was no stopping. School I think was just... if anybody had been through that, that was the thing, so I think you can become totally self-motivated because the world is out there and it's just available.

---

## 12. Humans' interest in science

> I think I had what most small boys have – and probably girls as well – which is just an interest in nature. In fact I've noticed in my own children that they always begin with this interest in nature, of seeds, of having animals swim around and looking down things at magnifying glasses. And then I think it is the formal teaching that destroys this. So if you just take as much of the formal teaching as is necessary to pass examinations, you needn't have this exploratory urge and I think that's one of the things that... that I think is... is science... and of course the fact that there is a way of actually asking and answering questions about nature.
>
> Well, the Wells book covers everything that was known about biology and so there was the whole thing about physiology, about how things worked, and how things worked seemed to me to be very important. I mean you know, I'm not trying... I'm trying not to add hindsight to all of this but just the fascination of knowledge in itself – that people had actually discovered, you know, that there were pigments involved in photosynthesis and this whole ability to, you know, draw the veil apart from nature. So I thought that that was something... that is what drove me. Now...
>
> Physics less so. It was this strange... it was biology which I... I thought was, you know, very important and it was just that attraction. I haven't been a good mathematician, I don't think I've been clever enough to be a mathematician. I found that physics, as it was taught to us, had got away from nature – it was all about pendulums and things like that – whereas biology was still there, and so that was the... that was the interest.

## 13. Going to Johannesburg University to study medicine

> Well, I had completed school at the age of... just at the end of my fourteenth year, and of course the war was on now so this was 19...

*[Q] What year was this?*

> I finished school in 1941, so in 1942 I went to university. Now, I didn't study science at university; what I did was I studied medicine, and the reason I did this was that I could get a bursary to go and study medicine and so on – because my parents would never have been able to afford it. So I got a bursary – it was £60 a year – from the Germiston town council; I won it in a competition.

*[Q] What was the competition?*

> It was just your exam results and interview and so on, and I got a bursary to go and study medicine. That, of course, paid my fees which were £60 a year, and I wasn't really interested in medicine but that's all there were bursaries for. And so the... this enabled me of course to go to university, but because there was no... my parents couldn't afford for me to go and live in Johannesburg or do that; I commuted every day from Germiston and that meant getting up... because classes started there at about eight o'clock in the morning, 8.30, so it meant getting up at about a quarter to six, cycling to the station which was about two and a half miles – which was quite hard on those cold winter mornings – catching the... the train, getting into the Johannesburg station and then walking to the university and doing this again at night and bringing sandwiches for lunch.
>
> So that actually... one lived at home, one didn't eat... I never ate in a cafe until... for quite a time, but always brought my lunch from home and then went back at home, you know, in the evening, catching the quarter past five train, and going out there, and getting my bicycle, and going back again.

## 14. Minyan Man

> I had also- I had got a sideline at that stage which allowed me to earn a sixpence a day and that was to be a- what is called a Minyan Man. What happens is that in order to say prayers, you must have ten adults there and of course you reach this adulthood at the age of thirteen. And so when I had undergone my Bar Mitzvah, I was then - because I was one of the poor people in the town - I was offered this job which meant coming every morning to the synagogue - which was actually on the way to the station, so you could just do it on the thing - and being present for people to come and say the Kaddish actually, the prayers for the dead, which they had to do on the anniversary and for which they needed ten people.
>
> And- so I spent quite a lot of time also, being the, the tenth man at prayers for the dead and I must say that I now don't go to funerals, it's one of my- I can't explain it but I just seem- I had enough of funerals for about four years of my life, of having to attend them and so on - as a professional mourner essentially - that now I don't go to funerals. I think I won't avoid being able to go to my own one but certainly not as a tenth man. However, so that was a- that paid sixpence a session, so you could earn a little bit more than that.

## 15. Science at university: Weinstein, Roux and Karnovsky

> At the university, that is where I met one of the most- I met a very interesting person who really taught me a lot in science. He was called Weinstein. He was a lecturer in the botany department. He had come as a refugee to Johannesburg - I don't even think he had a lectureship - but he was- but he taught there. The other person I came in contact with was a very great man called Edward Roux and it was Edward Roux who taught me botany, but what impressed-

*[Q] But what were you doing, doing botany in medicine - sorry Sydney?*

> The first year of medicine, you do Botany, Zoology, Chemistry and Physics, right, and so it's a pretty good scientific education. And the thing that I can remember that stands out most, was I used to spend, go after all the classes had finished to the labs in the Botany department and help Mr Weinstein every now and then and he showed me Chromatography. He showed me what I think was the first thing, it was all done on Kieselguhr and it was the separation of Carotenoid Pigments, just by absorption on to this, and that I just recalled as being tremendously impressive.
>
> As you may know, I mean we did a lot of laboratory work there; physics, chemistry. My teacher in chemistry, my lecturer in chemistry, was a man called Karnovsky, who later went on to Harvard and whose younger brother actually, Manfred, was with me, was someone I taught- Morris. Morris, Morris- Manfred was the older brother. Manfred had taught me, started to teach me chemistry there, he had come back there. I- he- I once criticised him. He asked me a question and I told him he didn't know what he was talking about and so, we still recall, he threw me out of the chemistry lecture- lecture theatre there because I argued with him. Actually, I was right.
>
> However, that really- there I started to really learn biology systematically and chemistry and physics and of course that- and of course going to university and not participating in university life in any sense because I would- I was a commuter and would go out, back each day, each night and so on. Being in South Africa, I was quite a good rugby player, and so I played a little bit of rugby in my first year, but I gave it up and-

*[Q] Sydney, if I could just come back to Roux and Weinstein. I mean, you said Roux was a very great man from your past. I mean these were very important influences, Weinstein and Roux?*

> Yes, well, I think Weinstein I just have, but Roux was- was- taught botany as a, as a living subject. I mean, it made me very interested, I think all the other- I mean zoology was deathly. We dissected a- we dissected a dogfish, you know, and one had to learn, start to learn almost by rote all of these things- there was very little functional thing. But it seemed to me that Roux had communicated, you know, what now would be called plant physiology. That was his interest at the time.

*[Q] Was any genetics there?*

> There was no genetics, in fact we didn't get taught genetics and I'll tell you how I got to genetics later on.

---

## 16. Edward Roux

> Well, Eddie I first came across as a scientist, but later I came across as a man and the author of I think the most moving book about South Africa, called *"Time Longer Than Rope"*. Because, Eddie of course was a left-wing activist all his life and his history, which I thought was tragic then, is even more tragic considering what has become of the world.
>
> Because Eddie was a communist, an early communist, dumped by the Komintern Agreement at the time, so he was branded as a Trotskyite, worked with the African movement as an independent until the time after the war, when he was still as great, and wrote this famous book about the history of African political movements and sort of gave me the- I mean I think it was really on knowing more about him and what he, and what he stood for, that led me to my reluctance to join any organisation and I never was a member of any organisation in the sense that people were members of political parties or political movements, because I've always felt you compromise if you join an organisation.
>
> And even now, when people ask me to sign petitions, I'm very reluctant because I just want to know who the other people in here and are they people I'd want to be associated with and I think that- so Eddie was, I think, a fantastic person as a scientist and as a man, and *"Time Longer Than Rope"* should be read by everybody, especially now, especially now.

## 17. My sad story of Harold Daitz

> Harold Daitz was a great influence on my life and in fact I found someone who had an understanding- this was someone who really taught me about the importance of asking questions in science and I spent hours, and this also came my love of just sitting around in the lab till all hours of the night, just talking. And of course it's something that my mother never understood, don't think my wife has still understood saying well, you know- why have you come home at four o'clock in the morning? And the thing is, well, you can't say- well we got talking, you know, and it just went on.
>
> And so, this is just something that was important. He went to England about a year before I did, he went to Oxford - Oxford I'll come back to that in a moment - and of course, when I came to England, and I came to Oxford, I went straight to his flat to see him to be greeted by his wife, that's Edna Rutowitz as she was, Edna O'Shaughnessy as she is now and to be told that he had died of a heart attack, the week before- I hadn't known.
>
> So, that I thought was- because one had all sorts of, you know, ideas about how great it would be to be doing science together.

*[Q] So he was in a way the first person you really spoke science to, was he?*

> He was the first person who spoke science, he was interested in neuroanatomy. Of course neuroanatomy and neurobiology are of course very interesting and very old interests of mine, and because of the influence of this whole school of people doing neuroanatomy in Johannesburg.

---

## 18. Joseph Gillman

> But I think the most significant person in many ways, and certainly the person about whom all the people that came under his influence never stopped talking about, and that was Joe Gilman. And Joe was then the Senior Lecturer in Histology and someone who exerted a great intellectual influence on a wide number of people and it was partly his interest, his interest in theoretical issues in science, I mean we used to spend hours and hours and hours discussing the difference between evocation and induction, Embryological Induction.
>
> But Joe started something that was very interesting. He had a brother called Teddy Gilman who actually came to England to Cambridge some years ago, many years ago and Joe and I started to read *"Biochemistry and Morphogenesis"*. We read it at lunchtime, that is, it was one of the things. I brought sandwiches and sat down there and read from this book-

*[Q] Aloud?*

> Yes, yes. That is, three or four pages used to be read at each lunch-time and discussed, it's very talmudic, but nonetheless that's the way I read *"Biochemistry and Morphogenesis"*.

*[Q] But I'd like to interrupt. But he was the senior lecturer and you were just a student.*

> I was just the student - I was an Honours student when all of this started - but I think Joe really wanted to be a theoretician, and of course, I think in retrospect Joe would want you to agree with the way he thought about it, and of course that was one of his failings, and although he was a great stimulus of people, there was this incredible love hate relationship. People couldn't stand to be with him.
>
> When Joe- I remember when Joe went to Accra - he left Johannesburg and went to Accra - we had just come to London, this was in the fifties, he left just after Sharpville. We used to say- any day and N'Kruma is going to arrive in London and say please let me in, and people were saying- why do you want to be here? He said- it's this guy Gilman, I can't stand him any longer, I've just got to get out.
>
> But that is the thing, and I still see friends of mine who went through this period, like Ben Kaminer who just, you know go back to those days and another- and so, Joe I think was a great formative influence. I think he was too much of a person who- he certainly was not an experimentalist in the sense that I had become one, you know, he was a great describer, his thesis was on the Golgi Apparatus and he had done- I mean there were all kinds of strange connections.
>
> For example, he started nutritional work. One of my jobs was actually to make amino acids, because of course we were doing nutrition on rats there, but we couldn't - it was during the war - we couldn't make amino acids. So, I actually manufactured Cysteine and Tryptophan by the classic methods. Cysteine from a barber, from the barber's shop, from human hair. There is a classical description of how to make Cysteine, and actually, Tryptophan from milk and Gowland Hopkins is, is someone who had given all those descriptions, so I had learnt to make amino acids and so on.

## 19. Seymour Papert

> Now a very important person in my South African life is someone- that is **Seymour Papert**. Seymour was someone about my age, contemporary of mine, and Seymour was a brilliant, is still a brilliant mathematician and in fact, much later in the course, he was also very interested in politics and philosophy and it was much later, while I was a medical student, that I got to know him very well and in fact, he taught me mathematics and I taught him physiology. Thank God it wasn't the other way around.
>
> And he is someone who I think got me interested in the whole idea of mathematical theories and ultimately in computers and things like this because he went off to MIT where he worked with Marvin Minsky on the whole field of Artificial Intelligence and so on. So he was a very good friend and a very important one and also, because of the fringe left-wing politics that we were associated together.

## 20. The beginning of my interest in biochemistry

> In my second year I went up to the medical school where I did Anatomy and Physiology, and that was the beginnings really of, of a new kind of interest, because physiology, I just found totally remarkable. Actually, what I found interesting there was, what is now called biochemistry and-

*[Q] And was there biochemistry as such?*

> It was taught as part of physiology. We did a little bit of biochemistry as it was called, which were largely sort of tests for- of urine for glucose. There was a kind of standard thing which every medical student went to. I have to say that the teaching in medicine in South Africa was based on the Scots system, and they aimed to produce someone who could leave the medical school and do everything in medicine and so we had a lot of courses there which I'll come to in a moment.
>
> But there were two people, there were a number of people, when I came to do second year medicine, that I found very, very stimulating. One was Joe Gilman, and since he's played quite a big role in mine and other people's lives, he needs something of his own, but I'll come back to that if you- we can leave that.
>
> So- but the one thing that I think you will- that I learnt during this which I found, is that this is the first time I came to realise my teachers knew nothing. And this had come because I discovered a book which is up there on the shelf- no, no- and which is called *"Perspectives in Biochemistry"*.

## 21. Realising my lecturers knew nothing

> What had happened was we had lectures on where bile pigments came from. And I had come to the conclusion that the lecturer must be wrong. And they'd given us an idea about the origin of bile pigments, that they were by biosynthesis and so on and of course this is from the degradation of... of haemoglobin and... but they had given us a theory of how these arose, which was archaic, and I had on first principles, come to the conclusion that the lecturer was wrong.

*[Q] What was the first principles?*

> Just the chemistry of the porphyrin nucleus and what had happened was I discovered in this book an article, by a man called Rudolph Lemberg – in this book – who actually worked on how the bile pigments came about. And what amazed me is that "my lecturers had never heard of him, but there he was, very important figure" and this book was in the... the library.
>
> Of course, that was that realisation but this book is... was full of the most remarkable set of papers that I had ever read. My textbook of physiology at the time was *Starling's Textbook of [Human] Physiology* and of course I found physiology fascinating and... the whole lot of things there. But in the terms of biochemistry, it is this book that opened my eyes to the great richness that could come from the molecular explanation of living processes.
>
> And I think it is then, in about 1943, that I had realised that you've got to do chemistry and biology, and there's got to be a science that studies the function of cells and which... and which... I didn't know what it was at the time, but which brings together life and chemistry in some strong sense.
>
> There are interesting articles there. For example, there's a very interesting article by... on... by Scott Moncrieff on the genetics of colour pigmentation in plants, which sort of closed the cycle on my old extracts of the leaves and the petals and so on, and I suddenly realised they knew all about this. But this was the beginnings of these ideas of biochemical genetics. Of course, they had older... but the beginnings of the ideas in my mind and the... and the first beginning realisation about genes, which of course I... I didn't know about at all, because we had no teaching in the subject.

*[Q] Did you discuss any of these ideas with anybody?*

> Well, I tried to discuss it with my teachers but, in fact, this was just impossible; there was no communication there.

## 22. What we learnt at medical school

> My colleagues were just a bunch of guys wanting to be doctors. In fact, during my second year anatomy... in those days we actually spent a whole year doing human dissection. There's none of this present style where you look it up in a book or a database; we actually dissected, and we actually had to know everything in the human body, because that is the way you did anatomy in the old days. There's a very remarkable professor of anatomy there, called **Raymond Dart**, who I'll come back to again.
>
> And... and also... so, now at the time this was an English language university – the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg – there were no Afrikaans speaking universities where people could do medicine or dentistry at that time, and so there were a lot of Afrikaaners came to this... came to do medicine here. And because of the nature of South African politics at the time, people were very careful as to who they put at a... at a dissection table. There were six of us, three on each side of the body when we changed places at this... and so I was assigned to a table with five Afrikaaners, because of my name; they had thought from my name I must be an Afrikaaner.
>
> One of the people I did keep up with, he later became a professor of dentistry in South Africa, a man called Dreyer. However, there I was, and they refused to speak English, so I learnt Afrikaans. I became fully bilingual. In fact, it stood me in great stead, because I could always get a booking on a railway train just by asking for it in Afrikaans. I became fully bilingual because we just spoke Afrikaans. Of course, I could speak quite a bit of it because I had played at school with Afrikaans... Afrikaaners and so on, but here I became fully bilingual. And in fact, I do have an accent which is still... and in my English accent, is still rather Afrikaans accent – not the usual kind of Jo'burg accent.
>
> So I had... I learnt anatomy, and I'd been to lectures during my course on histology because we had to do the whole of histology. And there was a remarkable man there called Joe Gillman who really believed in science and so on, and so I found this field of being able to look down a microscope, and actually see cells, completely fascinating.
>
> Now, when I think back of what we had to do in 40 weeks... because medical students worked hard. We had 40 weeks; it was eight o'clock... 8.00am to 5.00pm every day, many laboratory sessions. We had to learn anthropology, we had to learn palaeontology, a little bit of it, we had to learn the whole of histology, neurology, human embryology and be willing to answer questions on it, plus the whole of physiology. And all to be accomplished within one year.

## 23. Doing an additional BSc year

> Now, during the course of this year, it had become realised that if I just went on and did my six years medicine, I would finish medicine under the age of 21 and that I couldn't become registered at that time – you had to be over 21 to become a registered doctor. And so therefore I would have to spend a year doing something else.
>
> And one of the things that was available, which fitted in very nicely with everything, was a... a BSc degree. And of course the people who paid my bursary realised that I would have to do this in order... so they gave me an extra year. And I therefore deviated at the end of the second year to do a BSc in physiology and anatomy.
>
> And a small group of people did this each year... into this class, and one suddenly realised that now one was entering in... into science, because there were in that – especially in the histology department – a number of people who had not only done a BSc degree, but had done an Honours degree and a Masters degree and that they began to run the BSc class, and in this department people were actually doing research.
>
> And one of my teachers there was a remarkable man called Harold Daitz, who died quite young in... later on. Another man was a man called Mike Wright, who was about a year ahead of me, and who had gone on to do neuroanatomy. And so in that year, one really began to do research. That is, we all were put in a room and we were... all had a... I think there were about 11 of us.
>
> And two of my colleagues I still keep in touch with from that time; I saw one recently who had just retired as professor of anaesthesiology in University of... at Washington University in Seattle – University of Washington in Seattle. And this was absolutely an amazing experience because on the anatomy side, we had lectures in palaeontology from Robert Broom, and I still have a copy of his... of a book he gave me.
>
> We did a whole series of sessions with people in the department and that we were taught about the physics and chemistry of dyes as a basis of staining of tissue. My teacher here was someone who remained a friend for life, who was Joel Mandelstam. He had... he was a chemist who had joined Joe Gillman's department to do research and tried to do biochemistry there.
>
> We did projects in embryology, in... involving three-dimensional reconstruction of embryos from serial sections, traced out with a Camera Lucida onto sheets of beeswax and the thing stacked, and this technology I learnt. I also did a project in neuroanatomy and did a reconstruction of part of a galago brain, and it was absolutely the... a tremendous experience.
>
> On the physiology part we started to do some more biochemistry. Now one thing we could do was take up some project of our own... and from my reading in various books, I had become tremendously impressed by trying to work on cell physiology... on enzymology. And one of the things that was done in those days, was to measure oxygen uptake – that was the only way you could study oxidation and reduction pathways. You had manometers and you would add these enzymes and the things, and you would shake them, and you would watch to see the changes in pressure.
>
> And – there were two kinds – there was a thing called a Warburg manometer, and everybody worked with these, and of course there wasn't such a thing available, so I decided I'd build one, and I sat down and I first had to learn how to blow glass and grind tabs. So I actually did build a Warburg manometer and measure the oxygen uptake of tissues and this led me to say, 'Now I know what I want to do; I want to become a cell physiologist'. And I had become interested then in trying to find out now how cells could work and how... and how this... how one could do... how one could penetrate this.

## 24. Joe Gillman's philosophy of science

> From the other side, and the two things led together, as you will see, I became very interested in... in looking at cells under microscopes and what could you learn from this, and so I'd become very excited by the ability to do histochemistry – cytochemistry as it was called – and I thought somehow between the system that you grind up and the system that you can actually look at, you had to have some synthesis.
>
> Now of course, in those days, no one knew much about anything and so the questions that one always debated were: can you really find out about a living cell by taking it apart? And this is a great philosophical problem, and of course what one had come to realise, because of other things there, that Joe was a Marxist and so he believed in things...

*[Q] This is Joe Gillman?*

> Joe Gillman. So he believed in things called dialectical synthesis, which I never understood... but anyway, is that you learn nothing from the mechanical disintegration of this. Later I understood where all these ideas came from by actually reading Lenin's book *Materialism and Empirio-Criticism*.
>
> Now, you may say that how does one get to read all of this, and now I have to tell you that one of the great things we did is we did a third subject; we had to do, it was compulsory for everybody doing a BSc degree – that you had to do the history and philosophy of science... as a formal subject.

---

## 25. Getting into the philosophy of science

> One of the things that became very important in this course was that everyone had to complete a course of lectures and write an examination in the history and philosophy of science. The lectures were given by Brian Farrell, a logical positivist who later taught at Oxford.
>
> This aroused my interest in philosophy. We read works including Crowther's *"The Social Relations of Science"* and books on the history and philosophy of science, which introduced us to logical positivism. I became fascinated by people who had taken science and developed philosophy from it.
>
> From that year onwards, I spent considerable time reading philosophy. I read Moritz Schlick's work and physicists' perspectives on philosophy, particularly Max Born's book on causality in physics. This led me to quantum mechanics, and I read Einstein's popular books on the subject.
>
> We studied Aristotle and Plato as part of the formal curriculum, but what truly interested me was twentieth-century philosophy emerging from science. The political dimensions became embedded through Marxist influences. Meanwhile, I was becoming increasingly politically active regarding South Africa, all while trying to understand the twentieth century from this remote, provincial location during wartime.

## 26. Lab cocktails

> The next year, having deviated to do one year, the question is: do you go back to medicine? Most of my colleagues did, but I decided I was more interested in this, and so I would stay on and do an Honours degree. And so that's exactly what I did. Now of course my bursary was suspended, but I got a job in the department as a technician. That is, I was paid in lieu of fees, and I also was paid a small salary, and what I essentially did was make a whole set of teaching slides of the human body – histology, helping a technician.
>
> So I learnt how to embed human tissue, and, for that matter, animal tissue, but any tissue. I learnt how to section these. I learnt how to stain them and mount them, and so I became a... essentially histology technician and I used to go and work there in the department doing all of this.
>
> It is there also that I discovered the wonders of **Puccini's fluid**. Now, Puccini's fluid is nothing to do with the opera. Puccini's fluid was a preservative that was consisted of 70%... sorry, one part of 95% alcohol and one part of glycerine, and I had made this up and I was, I think, preserving some tissue in it or clearing it or something... I decided to have a taste of this stuff.
>
> And of course glycerine is exactly what you need to cut the taste, the bite of the alcohol and Puccini's fluid, which after having a taste, I... this was a Saturday afternoon – I woke up on the floor of the laboratory Sunday morning, still holding this 100cc measuring cylinder – I'd taken much more than a taste of it.
>
> But it actually is the best way to make lab cocktails. And a very good formula is absolute ethanol, and one should not use 100% actually because that has been cleaned by cold distillation with benzene, so it's pretty poisonous. 95% is good enough and one part of that, one part of glycerol and one part of orange juice or something like this, makes something that is so smooth, so tasteless and so effective that it's the best thing you can do, and so Puccini's fluid I think has a lot to recommend it.
>
> Actually, this discovery of the cutting edge of glycols was, as you know, used fairly recently when people were adding ethylene glycol to wine to give it that sort of mature taste. Except ethylene glycol is poisonous – it's... it's what you put in your radiators. You know, there was a scandal some time ago that they were poisoning the wine. But glycerine I can tell you is a natural compound and is perfectly safe. However... but that's a little sideline, and... but I learnt to do all of this and there I really started to do some... I really started on doing research.

## 27. My first ever research paper

*[Q] You did do a research project in your BSc, with the manometer.*

> Yes, I did that, I built the machine and I also did some other things. I started to do fluorescence microscopy, which we had then; in fact, wrote a paper on this work, together with Joe Gillman and Teddy Gillman.

*[Q] Your first paper?*

> I think it's my first paper.

*[Q] What was the paper about?*

> The paper was on porphyrin fluorescence in the liver of pellagra, and I went on to study... I've got a copy of that somewhere, and...

*[Q] But that must have been quite exciting.*

> It was very exciting, you see, and actually for me to realise... you see the porphyrins were connected with Rudolph Lemberg – that's when I learnt all about porphyrins.

---

## 28. Why I love pigments

*[Q] You always liked pigments.*

> I love pigments, I love colour...

*[Q] Why do you love pigments? I mean, given that...*

> Because you can see them, you see, and that's why I think sugar, sugar biochemistry and all this colourless biochemistry is really colourless. But pigments are amazing, and I've been fascinated by dyes, and in fact the whole idea of interpreting what you can stain, I really thought this was going to be the powerful way to... to study biology. Now of course during the... so sorry.

*[Q] Now, I want to come back... sorry, we need to understand how was it... I mean, here you were in Honours class, you'd never been with a group of people interested in science at all, and suddenly you're publishing a paper with the Gillmans.*

> Well, I started to work with this and now, for the first time, we actually sat around and talked about science and scientific problems during my BSc year and of course... more and more intensively as I stayed on there and they had run... of course, the apprenticeship system is a very different form of teaching, and putting you onto a project, and so, for the first time, actually, there were other people interested in science, other people trying to solve problems and so this was the beginnings of a kind of lab interaction, and the whole sort of concept that you could go... you could discuss how to do things and so on. That started in that BSc degree.

*[Q] And you actually got a pay. But it's unusual also to get a pay.*

> Yes, so I started because I had those interests and there was this paper that was published, and in fact I published very quickly in my Honours year several papers which depended on these.

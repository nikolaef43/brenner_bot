## 1. Coming from Eastern European stock

> Both my parents had come to South Africa from Russia. My father came from Lithuania, and he came to South Africa in 1910. It was a matter of sheer luck that he didn't go to America, 'cause he had a sister in America and his brother was in South Africa – his older brother – and when he got to London, he only had enough money for the boat to Cape Town, which was half the fare to New York, so he took that.
>
> His brother, who is someone I remembered very well, was much older than him and had come to South Africa about 20 years before that and was... had served in the Tzar's army in the Crimea in about 1870, 1880. And my father actually left to escape conscription to the army, which is most people... which is what the fate of most people was.
>
> My mother came to South Africa in 1922. She came from Latvia; she came from a town called Dvinsk; so she had lived through the entire period of the war and the revolution. My grandfather was an old Bolshevik who had left Russia in... prior to this, about 1907, and of course the family lived throughout the... the war and so on.
>
> My father actually left a brother in Russia and he and his family died of the famine in 1923 in a town called... which was then called Ekatrinograd *[sic]* and I think is now called Ekatrinograd *[sic]* again, but I believe it got changed to Gorky in the meantime, however – one of those things – so... and this... people had come to South Africa and my father had settled in a town just outside Johannesburg called **Germiston** where I was born.
>
> My father was a shoe repairer – cobbler – and we lived in a... two rooms at the back of his shop, as many people lived in those days. Next door was a... a plumber who'd also come from Eastern Europe, and they also lived in the back of the shop, but they... they advanced economically much more rapidly than we did.

## 2. Mother and father

> Well, my father was a shoemaker and not a well-educated man; he couldn't read or write at all, I mean, till the day he died. He had a great aptitude for languages and so he learnt and spoke two African languages: Afrikaans...

*[Q] But he couldn't read or write?*

> Could not read or write. My mother taught herself to read and write, so she was the only one who could speak English. In fact, when my father finally had to get naturalised, because, you know, none of this... we had to get a lawyer to get the forms filled out because he couldn't read or write, so that was the... that was his background.

*[Q] Was he a shoemaker till the end of his life?*

> Yes, yes, right till the very end, he went on working till he was over 80; wouldn't give it up. Everybody said, 'It's ridiculous', but he still had his little shop and went on doing this because... one of the people who felt that if you stopped work, you... you might as well just stop living.

*[Q] What did he feel about your science?*

> Well, he... you know, he didn't understand it, but he could understand why I was doing it; let's put it this way... and of course my mother never forgave me for not becoming a specialist – you know a doctor – but... but of course never tried to stop me basically. Well, I suppose they couldn't have done it anyway. So that was...

*[Q] Did your mother ever work?*

> No, my mother was always at home, you know, and looked after... looked after this... looked after the family and of course from a completely different... I mean, all that I... I can remember was, you know the great... the stories I used to hear about what it was like to be in Russia between, say, 1914 and 1922 – whenever she got out, you know – and there's these terrible stories of their... of this town which there were, you know, Red Latvians and White Latvians and Red Russians and White Russians; it exchanged hands almost every time.
>
> And the story I do remember being told as a young child was a story of one being sent to get bread and standing in line and finally getting half a loaf of bread, but by the time this... this child had walked home with this bread, had... by taking a little bit, had eaten the entire loaf, and the family waiting for this bread got nothing; it was empty. But, you know, one learnt about food being made with potato peelings but... and of course to... to hear all of this in... in Germiston; things that were going on was like getting news from an alien planet. I mean, first of all there was never any snow, so the concept of what was it like to live through a really hard north, northern winter, this just had no connection with us, so... and I think the kind of picture that you draw of the world from stories or from what you read is so false that, you know, one... one can never grasp it when one sees it in reality again that one's image of it was so wrong.

*[Q] Were they religious?*

> My mother was fairly orthodox; my father was a total agnostic. He didn't... he didn't practice anything and was against it all. My mother was of course... practised everything, and of course for a long time we had my grandmother living with us who spoke no English and spoke Russian and Yiddish only. So I learnt as a child to speak some Russian, because it was quite interesting. One always knew that when the parents and the grandmother spoke Russian, this was something they didn't want us to hear, so it became very important to try and find out what it was. So it was that kind of background.

## 3. Where did the insult 'Peruvian Jew' come from

> I think that to try and understand what the whole of this culture, or this immigrant culture in Johannesburg, was... it can be very easily illustrated by an original piece of sociological research that I conducted after I came to England. I was... met some people who said they'd met some nice South Africans who had come from Johannesburg and they were talking about mutual friends of them... of theirs, and the South African said, 'Oh, those Peruvians'. So they said, 'Well, we then went to the other people when we met them and said, "We didn't know you came from Peru", and they got very upset'.
>
> Now, I said to them, 'Don't worry, you know, this is a... this is a term of... of abuse and in fact it means... it's a kind of Jew who is stingy, mean, uneducated, uncultured'. And they said, 'But how... what on earth is the connection with Peru?' So I said, 'Well, look, I don't know, I've never thought about it until now, but I will do some research'.
>
> So I went and did research and the long story can be cut short. The following is the true origins of this word, because it was clear it was impossible for 90% of South African Jews to have come from Peru; that was inconceivable. I then discovered that when the immigrants came, there had been prior to this great movement at the turn of the century – the first 20 years – there had been a much earlier immigration of Jews from... largely from Germany, who of course were financiers and, incidentally, the same history is the same as the one in America. Namely the earlier immigrants, the Lehmans and so on, who'd come from Germany, were succeeded later by the East European ones.
>
> The people who had come from Eastern Europe decided to form an organisation which was called in Yiddish the **Polnischer und Russischer Yiddische Verein**, abbreviated to **PERUV** – Polnischer und Russischer Yiddische Verein. PERUV. And the people who attended this club came to be called *Peruvnics*, which fits, but later this had become anglicised, as indeed you know; Simon turned into Seymour, and, you know, all the names that come... and so they were called Peruvians. It was a much more gentile... hence the origin of the word Peruvian Jew. It only has... nothing to do with Peru but with origins in Eastern Europe and reflects exactly the age-old disdain that the German Jews had felt for the Eastern European immigrants – the Eastern European co-religionists.
>
> And that was that story, then, and... and of course it was amazing to me in later life to find that the same cultural thing had been gone through in exactly the same way in... in America. Later, when I got to know Ed Shils very well and went to visit with him in Chicago, exactly the same kind of history took place in Chicago between the earlier immigrants and the later people from Eastern Europe, who did that.

## 4. Early memories of living in a shop

> We had lived in the back of the shop, and I have this memory of playing on the floor, and still can remember the smell of leather that dominates my entire early life.

*[Q] Were you an only child, Sydney?*

> No, I had a sister who... my... my sister was two years younger than me, so she was born much later, and, of course, I should have mentioned, I was born on **13th January 1927**.

---

## 5. Learning to read from the tablecloth

> I learnt to read at a very early age because round the corner from us, again, there was a... a lady whose husband had been a tailor and she had died. But she had known my mother's family from Latvia because they'd all come from the same time – as it was called there, *Landsleute*; that is, all people who originated from the same thing – and I had gone... and I spent quite a lot of time with her. She lived in a tiny room where she cooked for herself, and she taught me to read from the newspapers that were on the table – which of course in lieu of tablecloths – and this is where I learned to read; so that by the age of four, I could read quite fluently.

---

## 6. Accelerated early schooling

> My father had a customer – a lady called Mrs McCartney – and they came into the shop – I must have been about four and a half – and she found me reading, and she said to my father that I should be sent to kindergarten and my father said that he couldn't afford it, but she said she would take me into this kindergarten. This kindergarten was run as part of the Presbyterian Church, in Germiston, and so I started going to kindergarten when I was five years old, and I did the first three years of... I was... very rapidly started... moved into the standard school curriculum, and so I did the first three years of what would be grade school in one year. So I did grade I, grade II and standard I, as they were called in South Africa, in one year, and then I went to the state school, the **Germiston Junior School**, and so I started at the age of six in standard II. So I was very far in advance of my age.

---

## 7. Libraries

> And of course the most interesting thing that I can recall from one of those is of course discovering the public library. A man called **Andrew Carnegie** was a great... a great donor to the world because he gave money to set up public libraries, and Germiston had a public library – the Carnegie it was called – and so getting in there and finding the world of books. So the world of books has always been very important – there were no books at home of course – and I rapidly graduated to the adult library, and of course I read voraciously about lots of things.

## 8. The early books that inspired me to do chemistry

> But one of the early books... there are two early books that I read while I went through school which were in the field of science and which I remember very clearly. One was called *The Young Chemist*, and this was a book by a man called Sherwood Taylor, and it gave wonderful recipes for how to do chemistry experiments, and I lost my copy of that unfortunately, but I'd started doing chemistry at the age of 10.
>
> By this time we had changed our houses and had moved into the house in the southern parts of Germiston – so that was 1937 – where there was a garage and which... we didn't have a car, and that's when I started to do chemistry in a serious way. It was very difficult of course to get apparatus and... and this, but I saved my money and bought a test-tube every two weeks or some reagent and of course went to buy these at the pharmacist.
>
> And... so those experiments there which were involved... you know, in making pigments and so on. I started doing biochemistry shortly after that, which was extracting pigments from leaves and petals and so on, and actually discovering that anthocyanin pigments actually responded to pH and, needless to say, that was not an original discovery.

## 9. Never more than top six in high school

> In the meantime, I had progressed through school and as... we did not have much choice; we would always pursue a standard curriculum, and the subjects that we did was English, Afrikaans – which was the other language there – Latin, general science, history and mathematics. And that was the standard education if you were going on to more important things. If you weren't going to go to university, then of course you did commercial arithmetic instead of Latin; that was... sometimes was called... I think in my day it was still called bookkeeping but later they called it commercial arithmetic – it just sounded better.
>
> And I think that during my period in high school, I wasn't... I wasn't the sort of top of the class student. I was good, I always got into the first six, but people never pointed to me and said, 'He's going to be the... the winner'. And so I was quite... this... and of course I... when I passed my exams I did get a first class, but I didn't get any distinctions, for example.
>
> Yes, and all the people actually that were thought to be the real winners, who got four distinctions in matric, went on later to a life of total intellectual obscurity and so I think that led me always to the conclusion that even if a student comes to me with a first class degree, he has to prove to me he could have got a second class degree if he'd tried. Because I think that kind of book learning and giving it back in examinations was not my forte.
>
> I think that what... because already I think I'd started to ask questions beyond this, especially in science, I realised that what I was being taught in chemistry and physics and so on was just the... was just what was in the book and what you needed to do to... to pass an examination.
>
> The teachers were not very good, and of course this was at a... you know, in a provincial place in a provincial country in a small school, but, you know, one learnt just the basic elementary paths of chemistry. Mathematics did not take you as far as calculus; it took you as far as the solution of quadratic equations.

## 10. Beaten, bullied and strangled

> School teachers... the... the ones I remember positively is, first of all, Mrs McCartney – the owner of this kindergarten. I remember her. I remember my teacher Miss Stein, from when I first went to the public school, standard... when I was in standard II and for the rest of them... I mean, I have memories of them as being just a completely bunch of cruel... there was a... they were really awful people in my high school who were...
>
> For example they... the boys had... there was a man called Mr Cooij *[sic]*, who said we all had to wear ties – I think from this period stems my total dislike of ties – and if you came to his class without a tie, then what he would do is he would take the... the cords from the skylights, the fan lights, the windows and he would tie this around your neck in such a way that your feet were about a quarter of an inch off the ground, so you either strangled or stood on tiptoe all through the class, so every boy who didn't get a tie was strung up there. So, you know, such things of... like cruelty were pretty standard.
>
> I remember my English teacher who didn't like the way I recited the only poetry that I remembered, which was from King Lear, and is this wonderful speech where Edmund decries the fact that he's a bastard and it's full of words like base, vile, bastard, bastard, which of course was wonderful to enunciate in public and... with the correct tone of voice, and all the boys that crossed his... that crossed him, we would have to crawl into the class and stand – I mean, it's just ridiculous – and be like dogs there, kneel by our chairs until we got permission to sit there. So school wasn't a very stimulating environment and one just...

*[Q] Were you beaten?*

> Yes, we were; we were beaten. We were extremely bullied as well. It was a school with... and all schools there were... and since I was small and two to three years younger than everybody else, I simply grew up to be a professional coward; it's the only thing... that is, I would agree to everything not to get bullied. So, you know... so that is... that is also something that helps you to withdraw and then have fantasies how you can get your revenge on all of these people, but that was the thing... so, in a way, going to university was a tremendous liberation.

## 11. Self motivation and independent learning

> Well, of course I had decided that I wanted to be a scientist.

*[Q] Why?*

> Because I thought that it was something that you could actually do, and I should have said that of course the thing that turned me onto biology was the book *The Science of Life* by Wells... Huxley and Wells, I think it is... just G P Wells. And this book, of which I still have the copy, which I have to confess I stole from the public library and told them I lost it because I couldn't get a copy of it at the time, and so I paid the fine which may be... may have been two shillings in those days – that's a lot of money – and that is the book that really turned me on to biology.
>
> Because of course the biology at school, that... the things we learnt were quite simple. You know, they were about beans and how beans grew and so on, and I was always very interested in the experimental part of it. And I had realised in this way that you didn't actually have to ask people to do things; you could just go and do them. If you can get hold of a book that told you... introduced you to how to do it, you could just go and do it.
>
> So that is something I think that I have kept with me all my life because I've never learnt anything from going to courses. If I want to learn a new subject, I get a book and I start doing it. And it's advice I've always gived... I mean, when I got interested in computing in the early '60s, I started by learning an assembly language and actually programming a computer because there's... and I think in today's environment where nobody can learn anything unless they go to a course, or do this in a formal sense, I just never had that since there was no one really to teach me, and so I had cultivated – not cultivated, it had just come, probably out of necessity combined with inclination – just the idea that knowledge is out there; it's available. If you can't buy the book you can always go to the public library and steal it if necessary. So, I think that that is... and I think that's one of the most important things, to become a scientist.

*[Q] Sydney, it seems you were totally self-motivated. There were no friends, no teachers, no parents, nothing.*

> Yes, I mean, you know, I'd fortunately grown up in a culture where learning was quite important. The... the old... the Jewish immigrants into South Africa had come with the old Jewish culture that learning was important and of course if one could divert this learning to become a surgeon or a lawyer that was even better. My mother always said you should never marry a girl because... for her money but it's just as easy to fall in love with a rich girl as it is with a poor girl. So, I mean, there was that kind of culture which never said, 'This is nonsense', and so there was no stopping. School I think was just... if anybody had been through that, that was the thing, so I think you can become totally self-motivated because the world is out there and it's just available.

## 12. Humans' interest in science

> I think I had what most small boys have – and probably girls as well – which is just an interest in nature. In fact I've noticed in my own children that they always begin with this interest in nature, of seeds, of having animals swim around and looking down things at magnifying glasses. And then I think it is the formal teaching that destroys this. So if you just take as much of the formal teaching as is necessary to pass examinations, you needn't have this exploratory urge and I think that's one of the things that... that I think is... is science... and of course the fact that there is a way of actually asking and answering questions about nature.
>
> Well, the Wells book covers everything that was known about biology and so there was the whole thing about physiology, about how things worked, and how things worked seemed to me to be very important. I mean you know, I'm not trying... I'm trying not to add hindsight to all of this but just the fascination of knowledge in itself – that people had actually discovered, you know, that there were pigments involved in photosynthesis and this whole ability to, you know, draw the veil apart from nature. So I thought that that was something... that is what drove me. Now...
>
> Physics less so. It was this strange... it was biology which I... I thought was, you know, very important and it was just that attraction. I haven't been a good mathematician, I don't think I've been clever enough to be a mathematician. I found that physics, as it was taught to us, had got away from nature – it was all about pendulums and things like that – whereas biology was still there, and so that was the... that was the interest.

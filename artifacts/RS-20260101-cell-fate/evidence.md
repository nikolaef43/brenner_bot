## EV-001: Asymmetric cell divisions and cell fate specification in C. elegans

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | paper |
| Source | doi:10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100913-013027 |
| Verified | Yes (Peer-reviewed Annual Review article by Rose & Gonczy (2014)) |
| Supports | H1, H2 |

**Relevance**: Canonical review of molecular mechanisms governing asymmetric divisions and fate specification in early embryo

### Excerpts

**EV-001#E1** (verbatim, Section 2.1, p. 127):
> PAR proteins establish anterior-posterior polarity through cortical flows that segregate P granules to the posterior, ensuring germ-line fate is restricted to the P1 lineage

## EV-002: WormBase Cell Lineage Database

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | dataset |
| Source | https://wormbase.org/species/c_elegans/cell |
| Verified | No |
| Supports | H1 |

**Relevance**: Complete cell lineage for all 959 somatic cells, essential for validating cell fate predictions

### Excerpts

**EV-002#E1** (paraphrased, Database summary):
> The invariant cell lineage of C. elegans produces exactly 959 somatic cells through precisely timed asymmetric divisions

## EV-003: Wnt signaling polarizes an early C. elegans blastomere

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | paper |
| Source | doi:10.1016/j.cell.2006.05.010 |
| Verified | No |
| Supports | H2 |

**Relevance**: Key paper showing MOM-2/Wnt signal from P2 polarizes EMS blastomere, demonstrating extrinsic fate determination

### Excerpts

**EV-003#E1** (verbatim, Results, Figure 3):
> MOM-2/Wnt signaling from P2 to EMS is required for proper specification of the E (gut) lineage, with loss of function resulting in transformation of E to MS fate

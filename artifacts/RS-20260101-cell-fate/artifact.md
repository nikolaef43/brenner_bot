## Metadata
- **Session ID**: RS-20260101-cell-fate

## 1. Research Thread

**Question**: What are the molecular mechanisms that determine cell fate in early C. elegans embryonic development, and how do intrinsic vs extrinsic factors interact to produce the invariant cell lineage?

**Anchors**: EV-001, EV-002, EV-003

---

## 2. Hypothesis Slate

### H1: Intrinsic PAR-Mediated Polarity (PAR Dominance)
**Statement**: Cell fate is primarily determined by intrinsic, cell-autonomous mechanisms involving PAR protein polarization that segregate fate determinants asymmetrically.

**Mechanism**: PAR proteins establish A-P polarity through cortical flows, segregating P granules and other determinants to specific daughter cells.

**Anchors**: EV-001#E1 [verbatim], EV-002#E1

**Key prediction**: Loss of PAR function should cause symmetric divisions with loss of germ-line fate specification.

**Confidence**: Medium-high (well-supported by EV-001#E1)

---

### H2: Extrinsic Wnt Signaling (Signaling Override)
**Statement**: Cell fate specification requires extrinsic cell-cell signaling, particularly Wnt signals from neighboring blastomeres, to polarize cells and specify fates.

**Mechanism**: MOM-2/Wnt from P2 signals to EMS blastomere, orienting the mitotic spindle and specifying the E (gut) vs MS fate.

**Anchors**: EV-003#E1 [verbatim]

**Key prediction**: Loss of MOM-2 should cause E→MS transformation regardless of intrinsic polarity.

**Confidence**: Medium-high (directly supported by EV-003#E1)

---

### H3: Third Alternative - Timing Program (Neither PAR nor Wnt Primary)
**Statement**: [inference] Cell fate is fundamentally controlled by a temporal program of gene expression that gates both PAR localization and Wnt responsiveness, making the molecular mechanisms epiphenomenal to an underlying timer.

**Mechanism**: [inference] A cell-cycle-coupled timer activates fate determinants at precise intervals, with PAR/Wnt serving as downstream effectors.

**Anchors**: EV-002#E1 (invariant lineage timing suggests clock-like control)

**Key prediction**: Altering cell cycle timing should decouple fate from lineage position.

**Confidence**: Low (speculative, marked as [inference])

## 3. Predictions Table

| ID | Hypothesis | Prediction | Evidence Anchor | Test Type |
|----|------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| P1 | H1 | par-3 RNAi → symmetric P0 division | EV-001#E1 | genetic |
| P2 | H2 | mom-2 RNAi → gut-less larvae | EV-003#E1 | genetic |
| P3 | H3 | Hydroxyurea arrest → fate specification continues [inference] | none | pharmacological |

---

## 4. Discriminative Tests

### T1: PAR/Wnt Epistasis Test
**Design**: Double RNAi of par-3 and mom-2, compared to single knockdowns.

**Discriminates**: H1 vs H2

**Potency check**: Single RNAi controls must show expected phenotypes (EV-001#E1, EV-003#E1 establish baselines).

**Evidence required**: Lineage tracing to count E cells vs MS cells.

## 5. Assumption Ledger

| ID | Assumption | Type | Check | Status |
|----|------------|------|-------|--------|
| A1 | RNAi efficiently depletes target proteins | methodological | Western blot | unchecked |
| A2 | The 959-cell lineage is truly invariant | scale_physics | Ref EV-002#E1 | verified |
| A3 | PAR proteins act cell-autonomously | boundary | Mosaic analysis | unchecked |

## 7. Adversarial Critique

### Critique 1: Evidence Gap on Timing
The third alternative (H3) lacks direct evidence and is marked [inference]. This is honest but highlights that the evidence pack does not contain temporal perturbation studies.

**Response**: Future evidence pack should include papers on cell-cycle mutants (e.g., cdk-1) and their effects on fate.

### Critique 2: Citation Density
H1 and H2 are well-grounded with verbatim quotes, but H3 relies on [inference] extensively. This appropriately distinguishes data from speculation.

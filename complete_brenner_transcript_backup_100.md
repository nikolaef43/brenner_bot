## 1. Coming from Eastern European stock

> Both my parents had come to South Africa from Russia. My father came from Lithuania, and he came to South Africa in 1910. It was a matter of sheer luck that he didn't go to America, 'cause he had a sister in America and his brother was in South Africa – his older brother – and when he got to London, he only had enough money for the boat to Cape Town, which was half the fare to New York, so he took that.
>
> His brother, who is someone I remembered very well, was much older than him and had come to South Africa about 20 years before that and was... had served in the Tzar's army in the Crimea in about 1870, 1880. And my father actually left to escape conscription to the army, which is most people... which is what the fate of most people was.
>
> My mother came to South Africa in 1922. She came from Latvia; she came from a town called Dvinsk; so she had lived through the entire period of the war and the revolution. My grandfather was an old Bolshevik who had left Russia in... prior to this, about 1907, and of course the family lived throughout the... the war and so on.
>
> My father actually left a brother in Russia and he and his family died of the famine in 1923 in a town called... which was then called Ekatrinograd *[sic]* and I think is now called Ekatrinograd *[sic]* again, but I believe it got changed to Gorky in the meantime, however – one of those things – so... and this... people had come to South Africa and my father had settled in a town just outside Johannesburg called **Germiston** where I was born.
>
> My father was a shoe repairer – cobbler – and we lived in a... two rooms at the back of his shop, as many people lived in those days. Next door was a... a plumber who'd also come from Eastern Europe, and they also lived in the back of the shop, but they... they advanced economically much more rapidly than we did.

---

## 2. Mother and father

> Well, my father was a shoemaker and not a well-educated man; he couldn't read or write at all, I mean, till the day he died. He had a great aptitude for languages and so he learnt and spoke two African languages: Afrikaans...

*[Q] But he couldn't read or write?*

> Could not read or write. My mother taught herself to read and write, so she was the only one who could speak English. In fact, when my father finally had to get naturalised, because, you know, none of this... we had to get a lawyer to get the forms filled out because he couldn't read or write, so that was the... that was his background.

*[Q] Was he a shoemaker till the end of his life?*

> Yes, yes, right till the very end, he went on working till he was over 80; wouldn't give it up. Everybody said, 'It's ridiculous', but he still had his little shop and went on doing this because... one of the people who felt that if you stopped work, you... you might as well just stop living.

*[Q] What did he feel about your science?*

> Well, he... you know, he didn't understand it, but he could understand why I was doing it; let's put it this way... and of course my mother never forgave me for not becoming a specialist – you know a doctor – but... but of course never tried to stop me basically. Well, I suppose they couldn't have done it anyway. So that was...

*[Q] Did your mother ever work?*

> No, my mother was always at home, you know, and looked after... looked after this... looked after the family and of course from a completely different... I mean, all that I... I can remember was, you know the great... the stories I used to hear about what it was like to be in Russia between, say, 1914 and 1922 – whenever she got out, you know – and there's these terrible stories of their... of this town which there were, you know, Red Latvians and White Latvians and Red Russians and White Russians; it exchanged hands almost every time.
>
> And the story I do remember being told as a young child was a story of one being sent to get bread and standing in line and finally getting half a loaf of bread, but by the time this... this child had walked home with this bread, had... by taking a little bit, had eaten the entire loaf, and the family waiting for this bread got nothing; it was empty. But, you know, one learnt about food being made with potato peelings but... and of course to... to hear all of this in... in Germiston; things that were going on was like getting news from an alien planet. I mean, first of all there was never any snow, so the concept of what was it like to live through a really hard north, northern winter, this just had no connection with us, so... and I think the kind of picture that you draw of the world from stories or from what you read is so false that, you know, one... one can never grasp it when one sees it in reality again that one's image of it was so wrong.

*[Q] Were they religious?*

> My mother was fairly orthodox; my father was a total agnostic. He didn't... he didn't practice anything and was against it all. My mother was of course... practised everything, and of course for a long time we had my grandmother living with us who spoke no English and spoke Russian and Yiddish only. So I learnt as a child to speak some Russian, because it was quite interesting. One always knew that when the parents and the grandmother spoke Russian, this was something they didn't want us to hear, so it became very important to try and find out what it was. So it was that kind of background.

## 3. Where did the insult 'Peruvian Jew' come from

> I think that to try and understand what the whole of this culture, or this immigrant culture in Johannesburg, was... it can be very easily illustrated by an original piece of sociological research that I conducted after I came to England. I was... met some people who said they'd met some nice South Africans who had come from Johannesburg and they were talking about mutual friends of them... of theirs, and the South African said, 'Oh, those Peruvians'. So they said, 'Well, we then went to the other people when we met them and said, "We didn't know you came from Peru", and they got very upset'.
>
> Now, I said to them, 'Don't worry, you know, this is a... this is a term of... of abuse and in fact it means... it's a kind of Jew who is stingy, mean, uneducated, uncultured'. And they said, 'But how... what on earth is the connection with Peru?' So I said, 'Well, look, I don't know, I've never thought about it until now, but I will do some research'.
>
> So I went and did research and the long story can be cut short. The following is the true origins of this word, because it was clear it was impossible for 90% of South African Jews to have come from Peru; that was inconceivable. I then discovered that when the immigrants came, there had been prior to this great movement at the turn of the century – the first 20 years – there had been a much earlier immigration of Jews from... largely from Germany, who of course were financiers and, incidentally, the same history is the same as the one in America. Namely the earlier immigrants, the Lehmans and so on, who'd come from Germany, were succeeded later by the East European ones.
>
> The people who had come from Eastern Europe decided to form an organisation which was called in Yiddish the **Polnischer und Russischer Yiddische Verein**, abbreviated to **PERUV** – Polnischer und Russischer Yiddische Verein. PERUV. And the people who attended this club came to be called *Peruvnics*, which fits, but later this had become anglicised, as indeed you know; Simon turned into Seymour, and, you know, all the names that come... and so they were called Peruvians. It was a much more gentile... hence the origin of the word Peruvian Jew. It only has... nothing to do with Peru but with origins in Eastern Europe and reflects exactly the age-old disdain that the German Jews had felt for the Eastern European immigrants – the Eastern European co-religionists.
>
> And that was that story, then, and... and of course it was amazing to me in later life to find that the same cultural thing had been gone through in exactly the same way in... in America. Later, when I got to know Ed Shils very well and went to visit with him in Chicago, exactly the same kind of history took place in Chicago between the earlier immigrants and the later people from Eastern Europe, who did that.

## 4. Early memories of living in a shop

> We had lived in the back of the shop, and I have this memory of playing on the floor, and still can remember the smell of leather that dominates my entire early life.

*[Q] Were you an only child, Sydney?*

> No, I had a sister who... my... my sister was two years younger than me, so she was born much later, and, of course, I should have mentioned, I was born on **13th January 1927**.

---

## 5. Learning to read from the tablecloth

> I learnt to read at a very early age because round the corner from us, again, there was a... a lady whose husband had been a tailor and she had died. But she had known my mother's family from Latvia because they'd all come from the same time – as it was called there, *Landsleute*; that is, all people who originated from the same thing – and I had gone... and I spent quite a lot of time with her. She lived in a tiny room where she cooked for herself, and she taught me to read from the newspapers that were on the table – which of course in lieu of tablecloths – and this is where I learned to read; so that by the age of four, I could read quite fluently.

---

## 6. Accelerated early schooling

> My father had a customer – a lady called Mrs McCartney – and they came into the shop – I must have been about four and a half – and she found me reading, and she said to my father that I should be sent to kindergarten and my father said that he couldn't afford it, but she said she would take me into this kindergarten. This kindergarten was run as part of the Presbyterian Church, in Germiston, and so I started going to kindergarten when I was five years old, and I did the first three years of... I was... very rapidly started... moved into the standard school curriculum, and so I did the first three years of what would be grade school in one year. So I did grade I, grade II and standard I, as they were called in South Africa, in one year, and then I went to the state school, the **Germiston Junior School**, and so I started at the age of six in standard II. So I was very far in advance of my age.

---

## 7. Libraries

> And of course the most interesting thing that I can recall from one of those is of course discovering the public library. A man called **Andrew Carnegie** was a great... a great donor to the world because he gave money to set up public libraries, and Germiston had a public library – the Carnegie it was called – and so getting in there and finding the world of books. So the world of books has always been very important – there were no books at home of course – and I rapidly graduated to the adult library, and of course I read voraciously about lots of things.

---

## 8. The early books that inspired me to do chemistry

> But one of the early books... there are two early books that I read while I went through school which were in the field of science and which I remember very clearly. One was called *The Young Chemist*, and this was a book by a man called Sherwood Taylor, and it gave wonderful recipes for how to do chemistry experiments, and I lost my copy of that unfortunately, but I'd started doing chemistry at the age of 10.
>
> By this time we had changed our houses and had moved into the house in the southern parts of Germiston – so that was 1937 – where there was a garage and which... we didn't have a car, and that's when I started to do chemistry in a serious way. It was very difficult of course to get apparatus and... and this, but I saved my money and bought a test-tube every two weeks or some reagent and of course went to buy these at the pharmacist.
>
> And... so those experiments there which were involved... you know, in making pigments and so on. I started doing biochemistry shortly after that, which was extracting pigments from leaves and petals and so on, and actually discovering that anthocyanin pigments actually responded to pH and, needless to say, that was not an original discovery.

---

## 9. Never more than top six in high school

> In the meantime, I had progressed through school and as... we did not have much choice; we would always pursue a standard curriculum, and the subjects that we did was English, Afrikaans – which was the other language there – Latin, general science, history and mathematics. And that was the standard education if you were going on to more important things. If you weren't going to go to university, then of course you did commercial arithmetic instead of Latin; that was... sometimes was called... I think in my day it was still called bookkeeping but later they called it commercial arithmetic – it just sounded better.
>
> And I think that during my period in high school, I wasn't... I wasn't the sort of top of the class student. I was good, I always got into the first six, but people never pointed to me and said, 'He's going to be the... the winner'. And so I was quite... this... and of course I... when I passed my exams I did get a first class, but I didn't get any distinctions, for example.
>
> Yes, and all the people actually that were thought to be the real winners, who got four distinctions in matric, went on later to a life of total intellectual obscurity and so I think that led me always to the conclusion that even if a student comes to me with a first class degree, he has to prove to me he could have got a second class degree if he'd tried. Because I think that kind of book learning and giving it back in examinations was not my forte.
>
> I think that what... because already I think I'd started to ask questions beyond this, especially in science, I realised that what I was being taught in chemistry and physics and so on was just the... was just what was in the book and what you needed to do to... to pass an examination.
>
> The teachers were not very good, and of course this was at a... you know, in a provincial place in a provincial country in a small school, but, you know, one learnt just the basic elementary paths of chemistry. Mathematics did not take you as far as calculus; it took you as far as the solution of quadratic equations.

## 10. Beaten, bullied and strangled

> School teachers... the... the ones I remember positively is, first of all, Mrs McCartney – the owner of this kindergarten. I remember her. I remember my teacher Miss Stein, from when I first went to the public school, standard... when I was in standard II and for the rest of them... I mean, I have memories of them as being just a completely bunch of cruel... there was a... they were really awful people in my high school who were...
>
> For example they... the boys had... there was a man called Mr Cooij *[sic]*, who said we all had to wear ties – I think from this period stems my total dislike of ties – and if you came to his class without a tie, then what he would do is he would take the... the cords from the skylights, the fan lights, the windows and he would tie this around your neck in such a way that your feet were about a quarter of an inch off the ground, so you either strangled or stood on tiptoe all through the class, so every boy who didn't get a tie was strung up there. So, you know, such things of... like cruelty were pretty standard.
>
> I remember my English teacher who didn't like the way I recited the only poetry that I remembered, which was from King Lear, and is this wonderful speech where Edmund decries the fact that he's a bastard and it's full of words like base, vile, bastard, bastard, which of course was wonderful to enunciate in public and... with the correct tone of voice, and all the boys that crossed his... that crossed him, we would have to crawl into the class and stand – I mean, it's just ridiculous – and be like dogs there, kneel by our chairs until we got permission to sit there. So school wasn't a very stimulating environment and one just...

*[Q] Were you beaten?*

> Yes, we were; we were beaten. We were extremely bullied as well. It was a school with... and all schools there were... and since I was small and two to three years younger than everybody else, I simply grew up to be a professional coward; it's the only thing... that is, I would agree to everything not to get bullied. So, you know... so that is... that is also something that helps you to withdraw and then have fantasies how you can get your revenge on all of these people, but that was the thing... so, in a way, going to university was a tremendous liberation.

---

## 11. Self motivation and independent learning

> Well, of course I had decided that I wanted to be a scientist.

*[Q] Why?*

> Because I thought that it was something that you could actually do, and I should have said that of course the thing that turned me onto biology was the book *The Science of Life* by Wells... Huxley and Wells, I think it is... just G P Wells. And this book, of which I still have the copy, which I have to confess I stole from the public library and told them I lost it because I couldn't get a copy of it at the time, and so I paid the fine which may be... may have been two shillings in those days – that's a lot of money – and that is the book that really turned me on to biology.
>
> Because of course the biology at school, that... the things we learnt were quite simple. You know, they were about beans and how beans grew and so on, and I was always very interested in the experimental part of it. And I had realised in this way that you didn't actually have to ask people to do things; you could just go and do them. If you can get hold of a book that told you... introduced you to how to do it, you could just go and do it.
>
> So that is something I think that I have kept with me all my life because I've never learnt anything from going to courses. If I want to learn a new subject, I get a book and I start doing it. And it's advice I've always gived... I mean, when I got interested in computing in the early '60s, I started by learning an assembly language and actually programming a computer because there's... and I think in today's environment where nobody can learn anything unless they go to a course, or do this in a formal sense, I just never had that since there was no one really to teach me, and so I had cultivated – not cultivated, it had just come, probably out of necessity combined with inclination – just the idea that knowledge is out there; it's available. If you can't buy the book you can always go to the public library and steal it if necessary. So, I think that that is... and I think that's one of the most important things, to become a scientist.

*[Q] Sydney, it seems you were totally self-motivated. There were no friends, no teachers, no parents, nothing.*

> Yes, I mean, you know, I'd fortunately grown up in a culture where learning was quite important. The... the old... the Jewish immigrants into South Africa had come with the old Jewish culture that learning was important and of course if one could divert this learning to become a surgeon or a lawyer that was even better. My mother always said you should never marry a girl because... for her money but it's just as easy to fall in love with a rich girl as it is with a poor girl. So, I mean, there was that kind of culture which never said, 'This is nonsense', and so there was no stopping. School I think was just... if anybody had been through that, that was the thing, so I think you can become totally self-motivated because the world is out there and it's just available.

---

## 12. Humans' interest in science

> I think I had what most small boys have – and probably girls as well – which is just an interest in nature. In fact I've noticed in my own children that they always begin with this interest in nature, of seeds, of having animals swim around and looking down things at magnifying glasses. And then I think it is the formal teaching that destroys this. So if you just take as much of the formal teaching as is necessary to pass examinations, you needn't have this exploratory urge and I think that's one of the things that... that I think is... is science... and of course the fact that there is a way of actually asking and answering questions about nature.
>
> Well, the Wells book covers everything that was known about biology and so there was the whole thing about physiology, about how things worked, and how things worked seemed to me to be very important. I mean you know, I'm not trying... I'm trying not to add hindsight to all of this but just the fascination of knowledge in itself – that people had actually discovered, you know, that there were pigments involved in photosynthesis and this whole ability to, you know, draw the veil apart from nature. So I thought that that was something... that is what drove me. Now...
>
> Physics less so. It was this strange... it was biology which I... I thought was, you know, very important and it was just that attraction. I haven't been a good mathematician, I don't think I've been clever enough to be a mathematician. I found that physics, as it was taught to us, had got away from nature – it was all about pendulums and things like that – whereas biology was still there, and so that was the... that was the interest.

## 13. Going to Johannesburg University to study medicine

> Well, I had completed school at the age of... just at the end of my fourteenth year, and of course the war was on now so this was 19...

*[Q] What year was this?*

> I finished school in 1941, so in 1942 I went to university. Now, I didn't study science at university; what I did was I studied medicine, and the reason I did this was that I could get a bursary to go and study medicine and so on – because my parents would never have been able to afford it. So I got a bursary – it was £60 a year – from the Germiston town council; I won it in a competition.

*[Q] What was the competition?*

> It was just your exam results and interview and so on, and I got a bursary to go and study medicine. That, of course, paid my fees which were £60 a year, and I wasn't really interested in medicine but that's all there were bursaries for. And so the... this enabled me of course to go to university, but because there was no... my parents couldn't afford for me to go and live in Johannesburg or do that; I commuted every day from Germiston and that meant getting up... because classes started there at about eight o'clock in the morning, 8.30, so it meant getting up at about a quarter to six, cycling to the station which was about two and a half miles – which was quite hard on those cold winter mornings – catching the... the train, getting into the Johannesburg station and then walking to the university and doing this again at night and bringing sandwiches for lunch.
>
> So that actually... one lived at home, one didn't eat... I never ate in a cafe until... for quite a time, but always brought my lunch from home and then went back at home, you know, in the evening, catching the quarter past five train, and going out there, and getting my bicycle, and going back again.

## 14. Minyan Man

> I had also- I had got a sideline at that stage which allowed me to earn a sixpence a day and that was to be a- what is called a Minyan Man. What happens is that in order to say prayers, you must have ten adults there and of course you reach this adulthood at the age of thirteen. And so when I had undergone my Bar Mitzvah, I was then - because I was one of the poor people in the town - I was offered this job which meant coming every morning to the synagogue - which was actually on the way to the station, so you could just do it on the thing - and being present for people to come and say the Kaddish actually, the prayers for the dead, which they had to do on the anniversary and for which they needed ten people.
>
> And- so I spent quite a lot of time also, being the, the tenth man at prayers for the dead and I must say that I now don't go to funerals, it's one of my- I can't explain it but I just seem- I had enough of funerals for about four years of my life, of having to attend them and so on - as a professional mourner essentially - that now I don't go to funerals. I think I won't avoid being able to go to my own one but certainly not as a tenth man. However, so that was a- that paid sixpence a session, so you could earn a little bit more than that.

## 15. Science at university: Weinstein, Roux and Karnovsky

> At the university, that is where I met one of the most- I met a very interesting person who really taught me a lot in science. He was called Weinstein. He was a lecturer in the botany department. He had come as a refugee to Johannesburg - I don't even think he had a lectureship - but he was- but he taught there. The other person I came in contact with was a very great man called Edward Roux and it was Edward Roux who taught me botany, but what impressed-

*[Q] But what were you doing, doing botany in medicine - sorry Sydney?*

> The first year of medicine, you do Botany, Zoology, Chemistry and Physics, right, and so it's a pretty good scientific education. And the thing that I can remember that stands out most, was I used to spend, go after all the classes had finished to the labs in the Botany department and help Mr Weinstein every now and then and he showed me Chromatography. He showed me what I think was the first thing, it was all done on Kieselguhr and it was the separation of Carotenoid Pigments, just by absorption on to this, and that I just recalled as being tremendously impressive.
>
> As you may know, I mean we did a lot of laboratory work there; physics, chemistry. My teacher in chemistry, my lecturer in chemistry, was a man called Karnovsky, who later went on to Harvard and whose younger brother actually, Manfred, was with me, was someone I taught- Morris. Morris, Morris- Manfred was the older brother. Manfred had taught me, started to teach me chemistry there, he had come back there. I- he- I once criticised him. He asked me a question and I told him he didn't know what he was talking about and so, we still recall, he threw me out of the chemistry lecture- lecture theatre there because I argued with him. Actually, I was right.
>
> However, that really- there I started to really learn biology systematically and chemistry and physics and of course that- and of course going to university and not participating in university life in any sense because I would- I was a commuter and would go out, back each day, each night and so on. Being in South Africa, I was quite a good rugby player, and so I played a little bit of rugby in my first year, but I gave it up and-

*[Q] Sydney, if I could just come back to Roux and Weinstein. I mean, you said Roux was a very great man from your past. I mean these were very important influences, Weinstein and Roux?*

> Yes, well, I think Weinstein I just have, but Roux was- was- taught botany as a, as a living subject. I mean, it made me very interested, I think all the other- I mean zoology was deathly. We dissected a- we dissected a dogfish, you know, and one had to learn, start to learn almost by rote all of these things- there was very little functional thing. But it seemed to me that Roux had communicated, you know, what now would be called plant physiology. That was his interest at the time.

*[Q] Was any genetics there?*

> There was no genetics, in fact we didn't get taught genetics and I'll tell you how I got to genetics later on.

---

## 16. Edward Roux

> Well, Eddie I first came across as a scientist, but later I came across as a man and the author of I think the most moving book about South Africa, called *"Time Longer Than Rope"*. Because, Eddie of course was a left-wing activist all his life and his history, which I thought was tragic then, is even more tragic considering what has become of the world.
>
> Because Eddie was a communist, an early communist, dumped by the Komintern Agreement at the time, so he was branded as a Trotskyite, worked with the African movement as an independent until the time after the war, when he was still as great, and wrote this famous book about the history of African political movements and sort of gave me the- I mean I think it was really on knowing more about him and what he, and what he stood for, that led me to my reluctance to join any organisation and I never was a member of any organisation in the sense that people were members of political parties or political movements, because I've always felt you compromise if you join an organisation.
>
> And even now, when people ask me to sign petitions, I'm very reluctant because I just want to know who the other people in here and are they people I'd want to be associated with and I think that- so Eddie was, I think, a fantastic person as a scientist and as a man, and *"Time Longer Than Rope"* should be read by everybody, especially now, especially now.

## 17. My sad story of Harold Daitz

> Harold Daitz was a great influence on my life and in fact I found someone who had an understanding- this was someone who really taught me about the importance of asking questions in science and I spent hours, and this also came my love of just sitting around in the lab till all hours of the night, just talking. And of course it's something that my mother never understood, don't think my wife has still understood saying well, you know- why have you come home at four o'clock in the morning? And the thing is, well, you can't say- well we got talking, you know, and it just went on.
>
> And so, this is just something that was important. He went to England about a year before I did, he went to Oxford - Oxford I'll come back to that in a moment - and of course, when I came to England, and I came to Oxford, I went straight to his flat to see him to be greeted by his wife, that's Edna Rutowitz as she was, Edna O'Shaughnessy as she is now and to be told that he had died of a heart attack, the week before- I hadn't known.
>
> So, that I thought was- because one had all sorts of, you know, ideas about how great it would be to be doing science together.

*[Q] So he was in a way the first person you really spoke science to, was he?*

> He was the first person who spoke science, he was interested in neuroanatomy. Of course neuroanatomy and neurobiology are of course very interesting and very old interests of mine, and because of the influence of this whole school of people doing neuroanatomy in Johannesburg.

---

## 18. Joseph Gillman

> But I think the most significant person in many ways, and certainly the person about whom all the people that came under his influence never stopped talking about, and that was Joe Gilman. And Joe was then the Senior Lecturer in Histology and someone who exerted a great intellectual influence on a wide number of people and it was partly his interest, his interest in theoretical issues in science, I mean we used to spend hours and hours and hours discussing the difference between evocation and induction, Embryological Induction.
>
> But Joe started something that was very interesting. He had a brother called Teddy Gilman who actually came to England to Cambridge some years ago, many years ago and Joe and I started to read *"Biochemistry and Morphogenesis"*. We read it at lunchtime, that is, it was one of the things. I brought sandwiches and sat down there and read from this book-

*[Q] Aloud?*

> Yes, yes. That is, three or four pages used to be read at each lunch-time and discussed, it's very talmudic, but nonetheless that's the way I read *"Biochemistry and Morphogenesis"*.

*[Q] But I'd like to interrupt. But he was the senior lecturer and you were just a student.*

> I was just the student - I was an Honours student when all of this started - but I think Joe really wanted to be a theoretician, and of course, I think in retrospect Joe would want you to agree with the way he thought about it, and of course that was one of his failings, and although he was a great stimulus of people, there was this incredible love hate relationship. People couldn't stand to be with him.
>
> When Joe- I remember when Joe went to Accra - he left Johannesburg and went to Accra - we had just come to London, this was in the fifties, he left just after Sharpville. We used to say- any day and N'Kruma is going to arrive in London and say please let me in, and people were saying- why do you want to be here? He said- it's this guy Gilman, I can't stand him any longer, I've just got to get out.
>
> But that is the thing, and I still see friends of mine who went through this period, like Ben Kaminer who just, you know go back to those days and another- and so, Joe I think was a great formative influence. I think he was too much of a person who- he certainly was not an experimentalist in the sense that I had become one, you know, he was a great describer, his thesis was on the Golgi Apparatus and he had done- I mean there were all kinds of strange connections.
>
> For example, he started nutritional work. One of my jobs was actually to make amino acids, because of course we were doing nutrition on rats there, but we couldn't - it was during the war - we couldn't make amino acids. So, I actually manufactured Cysteine and Tryptophan by the classic methods. Cysteine from a barber, from the barber's shop, from human hair. There is a classical description of how to make Cysteine, and actually, Tryptophan from milk and Gowland Hopkins is, is someone who had given all those descriptions, so I had learnt to make amino acids and so on.

## 19. Seymour Papert

> Now a very important person in my South African life is someone- that is **Seymour Papert**. Seymour was someone about my age, contemporary of mine, and Seymour was a brilliant, is still a brilliant mathematician and in fact, much later in the course, he was also very interested in politics and philosophy and it was much later, while I was a medical student, that I got to know him very well and in fact, he taught me mathematics and I taught him physiology. Thank God it wasn't the other way around.
>
> And he is someone who I think got me interested in the whole idea of mathematical theories and ultimately in computers and things like this because he went off to MIT where he worked with Marvin Minsky on the whole field of Artificial Intelligence and so on. So he was a very good friend and a very important one and also, because of the fringe left-wing politics that we were associated together.

## 20. The beginning of my interest in biochemistry

> In my second year I went up to the medical school where I did Anatomy and Physiology, and that was the beginnings really of, of a new kind of interest, because physiology, I just found totally remarkable. Actually, what I found interesting there was, what is now called biochemistry and-

*[Q] And was there biochemistry as such?*

> It was taught as part of physiology. We did a little bit of biochemistry as it was called, which were largely sort of tests for- of urine for glucose. There was a kind of standard thing which every medical student went to. I have to say that the teaching in medicine in South Africa was based on the Scots system, and they aimed to produce someone who could leave the medical school and do everything in medicine and so we had a lot of courses there which I'll come to in a moment.
>
> But there were two people, there were a number of people, when I came to do second year medicine, that I found very, very stimulating. One was Joe Gilman, and since he's played quite a big role in mine and other people's lives, he needs something of his own, but I'll come back to that if you- we can leave that.
>
> So- but the one thing that I think you will- that I learnt during this which I found, is that this is the first time I came to realise my teachers knew nothing. And this had come because I discovered a book which is up there on the shelf- no, no- and which is called *"Perspectives in Biochemistry"*.

---

## 21. Realising my lecturers knew nothing

> What had happened was we had lectures on where bile pigments came from. And I had come to the conclusion that the lecturer must be wrong. And they'd given us an idea about the origin of bile pigments, that they were by biosynthesis and so on and of course this is from the degradation of... of haemoglobin and... but they had given us a theory of how these arose, which was archaic, and I had on first principles, come to the conclusion that the lecturer was wrong.

*[Q] What was the first principles?*

> Just the chemistry of the porphyrin nucleus and what had happened was I discovered in this book an article, by a man called Rudolph Lemberg – in this book – who actually worked on how the bile pigments came about. And what amazed me is that "my lecturers had never heard of him, but there he was, very important figure" and this book was in the... the library.
>
> Of course, that was that realisation but this book is... was full of the most remarkable set of papers that I had ever read. My textbook of physiology at the time was *Starling's Textbook of [Human] Physiology* and of course I found physiology fascinating and... the whole lot of things there. But in the terms of biochemistry, it is this book that opened my eyes to the great richness that could come from the molecular explanation of living processes.
>
> And I think it is then, in about 1943, that I had realised that you've got to do chemistry and biology, and there's got to be a science that studies the function of cells and which... and which... I didn't know what it was at the time, but which brings together life and chemistry in some strong sense.
>
> There are interesting articles there. For example, there's a very interesting article by... on... by Scott Moncrieff on the genetics of colour pigmentation in plants, which sort of closed the cycle on my old extracts of the leaves and the petals and so on, and I suddenly realised they knew all about this. But this was the beginnings of these ideas of biochemical genetics. Of course, they had older... but the beginnings of the ideas in my mind and the... and the first beginning realisation about genes, which of course I... I didn't know about at all, because we had no teaching in the subject.

*[Q] Did you discuss any of these ideas with anybody?*

> Well, I tried to discuss it with my teachers but, in fact, this was just impossible; there was no communication there.

---

## 22. What we learnt at medical school

> My colleagues were just a bunch of guys wanting to be doctors. In fact, during my second year anatomy... in those days we actually spent a whole year doing human dissection. There's none of this present style where you look it up in a book or a database; we actually dissected, and we actually had to know everything in the human body, because that is the way you did anatomy in the old days. There's a very remarkable professor of anatomy there, called **Raymond Dart**, who I'll come back to again.
>
> And... and also... so, now at the time this was an English language university – the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg – there were no Afrikaans speaking universities where people could do medicine or dentistry at that time, and so there were a lot of Afrikaaners came to this... came to do medicine here. And because of the nature of South African politics at the time, people were very careful as to who they put at a... at a dissection table. There were six of us, three on each side of the body when we changed places at this... and so I was assigned to a table with five Afrikaaners, because of my name; they had thought from my name I must be an Afrikaaner.
>
> One of the people I did keep up with, he later became a professor of dentistry in South Africa, a man called Dreyer. However, there I was, and they refused to speak English, so I learnt Afrikaans. I became fully bilingual. In fact, it stood me in great stead, because I could always get a booking on a railway train just by asking for it in Afrikaans. I became fully bilingual because we just spoke Afrikaans. Of course, I could speak quite a bit of it because I had played at school with Afrikaans... Afrikaaners and so on, but here I became fully bilingual. And in fact, I do have an accent which is still... and in my English accent, is still rather Afrikaans accent – not the usual kind of Jo'burg accent.
>
> So I had... I learnt anatomy, and I'd been to lectures during my course on histology because we had to do the whole of histology. And there was a remarkable man there called Joe Gillman who really believed in science and so on, and so I found this field of being able to look down a microscope, and actually see cells, completely fascinating.
>
> Now, when I think back of what we had to do in 40 weeks... because medical students worked hard. We had 40 weeks; it was eight o'clock... 8.00am to 5.00pm every day, many laboratory sessions. We had to learn anthropology, we had to learn palaeontology, a little bit of it, we had to learn the whole of histology, neurology, human embryology and be willing to answer questions on it, plus the whole of physiology. And all to be accomplished within one year.

---

## 23. Doing an additional BSc year

> Now, during the course of this year, it had become realised that if I just went on and did my six years medicine, I would finish medicine under the age of 21 and that I couldn't become registered at that time – you had to be over 21 to become a registered doctor. And so therefore I would have to spend a year doing something else.
>
> And one of the things that was available, which fitted in very nicely with everything, was a... a BSc degree. And of course the people who paid my bursary realised that I would have to do this in order... so they gave me an extra year. And I therefore deviated at the end of the second year to do a BSc in physiology and anatomy.
>
> And a small group of people did this each year... into this class, and one suddenly realised that now one was entering in... into science, because there were in that – especially in the histology department – a number of people who had not only done a BSc degree, but had done an Honours degree and a Masters degree and that they began to run the BSc class, and in this department people were actually doing research.
>
> And one of my teachers there was a remarkable man called Harold Daitz, who died quite young in... later on. Another man was a man called Mike Wright, who was about a year ahead of me, and who had gone on to do neuroanatomy. And so in that year, one really began to do research. That is, we all were put in a room and we were... all had a... I think there were about 11 of us.
>
> And two of my colleagues I still keep in touch with from that time; I saw one recently who had just retired as professor of anaesthesiology in University of... at Washington University in Seattle – University of Washington in Seattle. And this was absolutely an amazing experience because on the anatomy side, we had lectures in palaeontology from Robert Broom, and I still have a copy of his... of a book he gave me.
>
> We did a whole series of sessions with people in the department and that we were taught about the physics and chemistry of dyes as a basis of staining of tissue. My teacher here was someone who remained a friend for life, who was Joel Mandelstam. He had... he was a chemist who had joined Joe Gillman's department to do research and tried to do biochemistry there.
>
> We did projects in embryology, in... involving three-dimensional reconstruction of embryos from serial sections, traced out with a Camera Lucida onto sheets of beeswax and the thing stacked, and this technology I learnt. I also did a project in neuroanatomy and did a reconstruction of part of a galago brain, and it was absolutely the... a tremendous experience.
>
> On the physiology part we started to do some more biochemistry. Now one thing we could do was take up some project of our own... and from my reading in various books, I had become tremendously impressed by trying to work on cell physiology... on enzymology. And one of the things that was done in those days, was to measure oxygen uptake – that was the only way you could study oxidation and reduction pathways. You had manometers and you would add these enzymes and the things, and you would shake them, and you would watch to see the changes in pressure.
>
> And – there were two kinds – there was a thing called a Warburg manometer, and everybody worked with these, and of course there wasn't such a thing available, so I decided I'd build one, and I sat down and I first had to learn how to blow glass and grind tabs. So I actually did build a Warburg manometer and measure the oxygen uptake of tissues and this led me to say, 'Now I know what I want to do; I want to become a cell physiologist'. And I had become interested then in trying to find out now how cells could work and how... and how this... how one could do... how one could penetrate this.

---

## 24. Joe Gillman's philosophy of science

> From the other side, and the two things led together, as you will see, I became very interested in... in looking at cells under microscopes and what could you learn from this, and so I'd become very excited by the ability to do histochemistry – cytochemistry as it was called – and I thought somehow between the system that you grind up and the system that you can actually look at, you had to have some synthesis.
>
> Now of course, in those days, no one knew much about anything and so the questions that one always debated were: can you really find out about a living cell by taking it apart? And this is a great philosophical problem, and of course what one had come to realise, because of other things there, that Joe was a Marxist and so he believed in things...

*[Q] This is Joe Gillman?*

> Joe Gillman. So he believed in things called dialectical synthesis, which I never understood... but anyway, is that you learn nothing from the mechanical disintegration of this. Later I understood where all these ideas came from by actually reading Lenin's book *Materialism and Empirio-Criticism*.
>
> Now, you may say that how does one get to read all of this, and now I have to tell you that one of the great things we did is we did a third subject; we had to do, it was compulsory for everybody doing a BSc degree – that you had to do the history and philosophy of science... as a formal subject.

---

## 25. Getting into the philosophy of science

> One of the things that became very important in this course was that everyone had to complete a course of lectures and write an examination in the history and philosophy of science. The lectures were given by Brian Farrell, a logical positivist who later taught at Oxford.
>
> This aroused my interest in philosophy. We read works including Crowther's *"The Social Relations of Science"* and books on the history and philosophy of science, which introduced us to logical positivism. I became fascinated by people who had taken science and developed philosophy from it.
>
> From that year onwards, I spent considerable time reading philosophy. I read Moritz Schlick's work and physicists' perspectives on philosophy, particularly Max Born's book on causality in physics. This led me to quantum mechanics, and I read Einstein's popular books on the subject.
>
> We studied Aristotle and Plato as part of the formal curriculum, but what truly interested me was twentieth-century philosophy emerging from science. The political dimensions became embedded through Marxist influences. Meanwhile, I was becoming increasingly politically active regarding South Africa, all while trying to understand the twentieth century from this remote, provincial location during wartime.

## 26. Lab cocktails

> The next year, having deviated to do one year, the question is: do you go back to medicine? Most of my colleagues did, but I decided I was more interested in this, and so I would stay on and do an Honours degree. And so that's exactly what I did. Now of course my bursary was suspended, but I got a job in the department as a technician. That is, I was paid in lieu of fees, and I also was paid a small salary, and what I essentially did was make a whole set of teaching slides of the human body – histology, helping a technician.
>
> So I learnt how to embed human tissue, and, for that matter, animal tissue, but any tissue. I learnt how to section these. I learnt how to stain them and mount them, and so I became a... essentially histology technician and I used to go and work there in the department doing all of this.
>
> It is there also that I discovered the wonders of **Puccini's fluid**. Now, Puccini's fluid is nothing to do with the opera. Puccini's fluid was a preservative that was consisted of 70%... sorry, one part of 95% alcohol and one part of glycerine, and I had made this up and I was, I think, preserving some tissue in it or clearing it or something... I decided to have a taste of this stuff.
>
> And of course glycerine is exactly what you need to cut the taste, the bite of the alcohol and Puccini's fluid, which after having a taste, I... this was a Saturday afternoon – I woke up on the floor of the laboratory Sunday morning, still holding this 100cc measuring cylinder – I'd taken much more than a taste of it.
>
> But it actually is the best way to make lab cocktails. And a very good formula is absolute ethanol, and one should not use 100% actually because that has been cleaned by cold distillation with benzene, so it's pretty poisonous. 95% is good enough and one part of that, one part of glycerol and one part of orange juice or something like this, makes something that is so smooth, so tasteless and so effective that it's the best thing you can do, and so Puccini's fluid I think has a lot to recommend it.
>
> Actually, this discovery of the cutting edge of glycols was, as you know, used fairly recently when people were adding ethylene glycol to wine to give it that sort of mature taste. Except ethylene glycol is poisonous – it's... it's what you put in your radiators. You know, there was a scandal some time ago that they were poisoning the wine. But glycerine I can tell you is a natural compound and is perfectly safe. However... but that's a little sideline, and... but I learnt to do all of this and there I really started to do some... I really started on doing research.

## 27. My first ever research paper

*[Q] You did do a research project in your BSc, with the manometer.*

> Yes, I did that, I built the machine and I also did some other things. I started to do fluorescence microscopy, which we had then; in fact, wrote a paper on this work, together with Joe Gillman and Teddy Gillman.

*[Q] Your first paper?*

> I think it's my first paper.

*[Q] What was the paper about?*

> The paper was on porphyrin fluorescence in the liver of pellagra, and I went on to study... I've got a copy of that somewhere, and...

*[Q] But that must have been quite exciting.*

> It was very exciting, you see, and actually for me to realise... you see the porphyrins were connected with Rudolph Lemberg – that's when I learnt all about porphyrins.

---

## 28. Why I love pigments

*[Q] You always liked pigments.*

> I love pigments, I love colour...

*[Q] Why do you love pigments? I mean, given that...*

> Because you can see them, you see, and that's why I think sugar, sugar biochemistry and all this colourless biochemistry is really colourless. But pigments are amazing, and I've been fascinated by dyes, and in fact the whole idea of interpreting what you can stain, I really thought this was going to be the powerful way to... to study biology. Now of course during the... so sorry.

*[Q] Now, I want to come back... sorry, we need to understand how was it... I mean, here you were in Honours class, you'd never been with a group of people interested in science at all, and suddenly you're publishing a paper with the Gillmans.*

> Well, I started to work with this and now, for the first time, we actually sat around and talked about science and scientific problems during my BSc year and of course... more and more intensively as I stayed on there and they had run... of course, the apprenticeship system is a very different form of teaching, and putting you onto a project, and so, for the first time, actually, there were other people interested in science, other people trying to solve problems and so this was the beginnings of a kind of lab interaction, and the whole sort of concept that you could go... you could discuss how to do things and so on. That started in that BSc degree.

*[Q] And you actually got a pay. But it's unusual also to get a pay.*

> Yes, so I started because I had those interests and there was this paper that was published, and in fact I published very quickly in my Honours year several papers which depended on these.

---

## 29. Archaeology and palaeontology

> Now, also at that time, another interest had emerged, which threatened effectively to become an alternative profession, but I stopped it. But I'll just tell you a little about it. Raymond Dart had been made famous throughout the world for the discovery of Australopithecus. This was a skull... a fossil skull of what was supposed to be the missing link, and nothing much had... more had been done on that and this was being questioned and so on.
>
> And then Robert Broom had found these skulls... although Robert Broom was well known for all his work on reptile palaeontology, but he had started to excavate caves just outside a town called Krugersdorp, called Sterkfontein and Kromdraai. And in our science year we... we decided we would go on expedition to Sterkfontein and... in order to go and try... we went with Broom and, in fact, that was the beginning of mounting more and more expeditions to try and do excavations and so on.
>
> So I got led through this to a very deep interest in archaeology and palaeontology and that of course did echo something about one's interest in nature again, and here it had come back the other way and of course this is... this had brought me directly in... into contact with, you know, problems of evolution in this way.
>
> So I know that this sounds as if a lot of things were being done at the same time, but that is what it was like. So, you know, Saturday afternoon... or we would go for the weekend to Sterkfontein; we would go and dig in the caves or sort rubble all day; we'd play poker all night. We played poker, which depended on using sheets of toilet paper – scrip – and in fact I... there was this hysterical evening. You know, there was the Sterkfontein skull that everybody knew about, and what happened is at 2.00am one morning, I got what I called the Sterkfontein hand, and this was a royal flush. It's the first and only time I got it – I cleaned them out of their toilet paper scrip, but that's the only thing I ever discovered from this excavation, was the Sterkfontein hand, which was a royal flush in hearts. That I'll never forget. In fact, we woke everybody up at 2.00am to show this great discovery of the Sterkfontein hand, but there you are, so...
>
> And then you back to the lab on Monday, you know, do a little bit of neuroanatomy and on Wednesday, do something else. So it was a very sort of, you know, life in which everything was on the go. And one had developed a little coterie of people who were not just interested in, you know, just going to university and qualifying and so on.

---

## 30. Forming a territorial army

> I should also say that I also spent... I was also in the army at this time. In fact, what had happened was, as part of the war effort, the university students and the medical students had formed something that was a... like the territorial army – that is, a kind of weekend army – as part of this, and in fact there was the... the whole of the Johannesburg Medical School had formed a field ambulance. I think it was called the **25th Field Ambulance**, and in fact there were two full-time soldiers that actually occupied offices in the medical school, and the head of the ambulance was Professor Dart, who had the rank of colonel and then all the other lecturers in the medical school had different ranks.
>
> In fact, a very old friend of mine, John Robinson, who was a medical student a little bit ahead of me; he was very famous as the man who broke down when we went on our annual three week camp and was sent home in... in tears.

---

## 31. The Army camps

> So in the army – the 25th Field Ambulance – we would go to camp on weekends. That is, we would collect trucks in Johannesburg at two o'clock on... and meet at two o'clock on Saturday afternoon, go out to one of the army camps, and then of course come back on Sunday evening and that during the holidays, which was during July – it was still very cold, especially at the height of Johannesburg – we would go for a two to three week camp.
>
> And one of the camps we went to was out in the bush so we could spend a bit of time doing some archaeology on the side and here we would do exercises and manoeuvres and actually bring people in. I rose to the rank of corporal actually, but I think I was too young to be promoted any further than that, and I served my time and I learnt how to drive.
>
> And I also became a cook with a man called Cecil Luck, whom was a lecturer in the physiology department – a very interesting man who went out to Uganda to teach there and of course returned to South Africa when that changed the way it did. But he was a physiologist and he was in fact in charge of the cooking, and of course I should hesitate to say that that's where I learnt how to cook – possibly that's where I learnt how not to cook – but that is just one the things that one learnt, and it also...
>
> And all of this, having grown up in a small town which had... in which the big scene... the big feature were all these mine dumps; that is the dumps of all the sand and clay that had come from extracting gold. These yellow mine dumps, flat, completely artificial. The only place one had ever seen was Germiston Lake, which was in fact the remnants of an old mine. The whole idea of getting right out into... into the bush was amazing. I mean that already happened in going out to Sterkfontein and it happened more and more with the army camps. And then, of course, later on as we went on more and more archaeological expeditions... so this opened up this whole incredible country, and coming from a small, urban thing where the... everything... there was no nature, no... nothing to see, this was one of the most incredible eye-openers of the time.

---

## 32. Geology: expedition with Alexander du Toit

> I then had developed this... this very great interest in archaeology and palaeontology, and so going out on these camps had become a regular thing, and in fact I went... in 1947, I went on an expedition with a man called Bosazzar and another man called Ray Adie, both of whom were geologists. We went on an expedition to the Kalahari Desert and it was... and I had been there before to parts of this, but actually I wrote a scientific paper on this... on the whole idea that there were these desert cycles in Africa which... which were most important for how the whole development of this thing, and that these were correlated, basically, with the cycles – the glacial cycles that were better known in the north...

*[Q] So you learnt geology too?*

> Yes, I learnt geology. In fact I learnt quite a lot of geology. In fact, I'd become quite an expert on it and did later... and in 1947 or '48, I can't remember, when a big expedition came out from the University of California who wanted to see all the sights, I went with them and I went essentially as a guide, and that's where I met – because they'd asked him to go – **Alex du Toit**. Alex du Toit, as it would be called in French, but du Toit as we called it, was one of the most remarkable people. He is the... one of the great inventors of Gondwanaland, he's... with Wegener, and his book, *The Geology of South Africa*, of which I have a copy, is in fact the whole of the idea of the wandering continents, and he had come to the conclusion of geology alone that Africa and South America were once joined up.
>
> Now, he had a most remarkable life. He was already quite an old man when I met him, and he had gone out to survey the Kalahari Desert – which is where we went – as a young man for the geological survey in about 1890. In fact, the geological maps were the ones he made. And he turned up there dressed like, I would say, a Dutch Reform Church preacher. He was dressed in a black suit with a waistcoat and a tie and a hat. Now, all the Americans had come out you know, in expedition outfits with... with bush hats with little leopard skin rings. I had come out in my thing, which was shorts and boots and a shirt and a hat because we wore this, but du Toit had come there dressed in this beautiful suit.
>
> And I remember that one wonderful thing that happened on this trip was we were going along a road in the Kalahari Desert, in the middle of nowhere, and the people were asking about water divination, so he said he believes in it. So they said, 'You, a scientist; you believe in water divination?' He says, 'Yes'. He says, 'Just stop the car here'. He says, 'I'll show it to you, prove it to you'. So stop the car apparently in the middle of nowhere, and he gets out of the car and he cuts a branch, and he goes about... does this sort of tremendous amount of formality and ritual, and then he walks along the road and the thing bends. And he says, 'Well', he says, 'this means there must be water somewhere, so there should be a fault line somewhere here, and if we just go off down here, let's go and look for it'. And sure enough, we go down there and there's this thing, which... there's a little... little spring there – it had dried up, but you could see there had been a spring there. So all these Americans were amazingly impressed by this.
>
> And when we were going back, he started to tell me in Afrikaans how he came through here as a young man in about 1890 on an ox wagon doing... making the geological survey of this region and that he had found the spring here and that he recognised the topography of the land while we were talking. So I found this to be very amazing thing. However, he had a... this gives one an eye for country. It gives one an eye that one can look at a... at... at the topography and see its history in it. And of course, as you may imagine, this was threatening to become another profession and so I decided to give it up.
>
> And a colleague of mine who was one year behind me, Philip Tobias, he decided that he would continue it and I've always enjoyed it as a hobby; I've always enjoyed... I've just enjoyed the idea that one can go out and look at a country and of course extract its history from it, and of course that's another interest of course I've had in astronomy.

## 33. "To Serve Man"

> Astronomy I'm a complete amateur. I got interested in this... of course, if you live in the southern hemisphere you can't... you can't but be interested in the sky, and of course I would say that most of my interest in the stars was as a... an assiduous reader of science fiction. I became... from about the age of eight – seven or eight – I became a reader of science fiction and this had come about... if I can go back to there...
>
> One of my mother's brothers was... was rather wealthy; that is, he had done well. He had a shop in Fordsburg where he sold first bicycles and then... and then radios, and he had done very well, Uncle Harry, and was not married. And I used to go and visit him and one of the things that there was in the street in Fordsburg was... Fordsburg was a suburb of... of Johannesburg, next to an equally depressed area called Mayfair, surprisingly enough, just out on the western suburbs and was inhabited by a lot of people, mostly poor whites then, who had come in as being displaced from the land, had come into the city, mostly Afrikaaners who had come in as a result of the agricultural depression in the thirties. And so they... they were the clientele there, and my uncle would always take me for lunch to the Fordsburg Hotel – which is where he had his lunch – where we'd have something that I think you can only get in South Africa called a mixed grill, and I actually knew someone who could eat three South African mixed grills and... and survive, but still.
>
> And then he would give me some money – half a crown, which was, well, amazing – and I would go to this second-hand bookstore where this person had past numbers of something called *Amazing Stories* which you could buy for about tuppence each. These were the pulp magazines – there were two of them which were the best; one was called *Amazing Stories*; other called *Astounding Stories*. They came from... they came from... America and I collected these and this is where I encountered, you know, all the great names – Robert Heinlein and so on.
>
> And I still have an enormous collection of science fiction. In fact, this stood me very well in later years, when Francis Crick wrote a paper on the idea of Pangenesis, namely that all life... Panspermia, I'm sorry – that all life had been brought here from outer space and the planet seeded. I told him that I'd read this somewhere before, and he said that was very interesting, could I give him the reference. I said, well, I can't remember the exact number, but it was *Amazing Stories*, either 1936 or 1937, I'm sure you could find... find it there; it's been published before and he should be careful, you know, not to be accused of plagiarism.
>
> However... but this again was, you know, an interesting... another way of looking at the world and of course in the early days it was the kind of small boy interest. But in later years I... I liked this a lot for what it explored about society and human nature, and I think that some of the inversions, the unexpected inversions... and I can remember two of these, because there's a sort of thinking that I liked... I liked the... I like the playing with words, and the one I think very, very well of is the one written by a man called... August Derleth *[sic]* I think his name is. The title of this article is *How to Serve Man* *[sic]*, and it says that earth is in a terrible state. These people come from outer space and they bring enormous benefits; they give humanity boxes which are endless supplies of energy and they just exude goodness – altruism. Of course, the... the teller of the story is a journalist who is deeply suspicious of all of this and all his friends say, 'No, no, no, these come from another planet; they're completely altruistic; there are no hidden motives', and what is then... they then say their slogan is *How To Serve Man* *[sic]* – that's what they've entitled it – and they have these courses that people get elected for and go and get taken to wonderful places where they get educated and so on, except what is very strange is that no one has ever met anybody who's come back from this.
>
> And of course, the investigation goes on when he discovers that what these people are really interested in is cooking and eating, and *How to Serve Man* *[sic]* is in fact not only the title of the most important book in their culture but it's a recipe book, and of course that's the end of the story.
>
> So I think this kind of duality has always appealed to me and there are lots of other cases of it and... and I think their experiments with societies, some of them are, I think, brilliant. *The Space Merchants* I think is a brilliant parody of America; of the future. The only thing in this is, you know, it's come true basically – that's the disappointing thing.

## 34. Language and wordplay

*[Q] Your... your passion for words and language, I mean, which is the first time you've mentioned it; did you read novels and poetry?*

> Oh yes; I didn't read much poetry but I've always been a great devourer of books, indiscriminate of course, so I read everything that I can lay my hands on. I did not much enjoy the sort of formal text that we were given at school; in fact I have an... I have a total dislike for Sir Walter Scott, after being forced to read *Quentin Durward* for my matric – as far as I'm concerned, I never want to read another thing. However... but it is just the... the whole idea of... of this communication has been... has been an interest of mine for a very long time.

*[Q] The wordplay, Sydney?*

> The wordplay I think is part of... is part of the way one... one learns to think. I think wordplay is just alternative interpretations of the same thing, and I think that that's a lot of... a lot of science involves that: of... of taking... looking at the thing on the surface and see that there... there's more than one way of looking at it and see there's more than one way of extracting something from it.

*[Q] But did you get pleasure from this wordplay even when rather young or do you think it was something that came to you later?*

> Yes, well I think the... the idea of punning is... there's probably a gene for it in our family because my grandson is exactly like this. At quite a young age he is already inventing words and doing things like this. I mean, inventing words is a good one; for example, he has... he has an invention of a... a Jewish-Japanese restaurant, which is called **Sosumi** – an American Jewish-Japanese restaurant. So this is... the... the wordplay is part of the way one manipulates one's thinking, and so I think that's also part of it.

## 35. The Nadi reaction

> During my Honours year, I again expanded my interests into large parts of biology, because that's the one thing this... this enables one to do. But I had started to do things in... in cytochemistry, and, in fact, one of the interesting things was to do something which was called the **Nadi reaction**. Now, the Nadi reaction has, in recent years, come into favour as a measurement of the cytochrome oxidase system. But I can honestly say that I was the first person to discover that.
>
> It had been known as the Nadi reaction and it had measured some enzyme called... which was called indophenol oxidase, and what you did was you took these two components, diphenyl diamine, and you put it in and when you had this enzyme, it made this com... it made this blue dye, indophenol blue.
>
> And I did a set of experiments which actually proved that this was related to what had then been called... had then been called cytochrome oxidase. Because what I showed... it was mitochondria that gave you the Nadi reaction, all right? And... and I actually wrote a paper on this and published it as part of the annual meeting of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science in 1946, so it goes back a long way.

*[Q] It wasn't your first; that was one of your later papers?*

> Yeah, that was the second... my second paper, yes.

---

## 36. My MSc in working out the chromosome complement of Elephantulus

> After completing my Honours degree, I pursued a Master's degree, using the extra year to study genetics and chromosomes. I was profoundly influenced by Edmund Beecher Wilson's *"The Cell in Development and Heredity,"* particularly the passage stating that "The chromosomes are the bearers... the material bearers of heredity."
>
> Beginning with onion root specimens, I taught myself cytogenetics using two key texts: CD Darlington's *"Recent Advances in Cytogenetics"* (1937) and Darlington and La Cour's *"The Handling of Chromosomes."* I selected the **Elephantulus** – a small shrew native to South Africa – as my research subject.
>
> My Master of Science thesis, *"The Chromosome Complement of Elephantulus,"* represented pioneering cytogenetic work in South Africa. Though I initially reported an incorrect number (14 rather than 28), this research established the field locally. Philip Tobias subsequently studied the gerbil, further developing cytogenetics in the region. I characterized this work as "the first sort of connection of genes and cells," continuing my broader investigation into cellular mechanisms.

## 37. Microscopy

> There was at that time a rather remarkable person in the... in the histology department called Alf Oettli, and Alf Oettli was a microscopist, and he believed in dark field microscopy, because he had learned this from a very famous man called Adrianus Pijper. Now, Adrianus Pijper was a man who had seen flagellae of bacteria under dark field, and of course it was through Alf Oettli that I really learnt about microscopy as a subject.
>
> One of the things that you needed to do this was an intense source of illumination, and so what we built was... is... was a heliostat. This was a mirror which effectively was hooked to a clock so that it followed the sun and would pick up the sun and reflect it into the lab so that we had with this heliostat and in the days of... of brilliant sunshine, especially that you get during the winter in South Africa, this report... this gave us a remarkable set of... gave us a remarkable source of illumination.

## 38. Broad academic discussion as a student

> There were... at that time in Johannesburg, there were lots of people who had become great admirers of Ludwig Wittgenstein, and, in fact, many came to Cambridge; Duncan Linney was one of those people who had become... come to sit at the feet of Wittgenstein. And of course logical positivism was 'in' in those days, and we used to have many discussions in this field of which we'd come to the conclusion that the fundamental question in philosophy was: 'define define', which was always a good remark to be said after a long discussion; you could ask, 'Define define'.
>
> So there's all that kind of student turmoil, and of course, all of this spilled over into other things; I had very good friends who were highly interested in the arts, Stanley Glasser being one of them, and so music... in fact we actually made a film. All of us together: I wrote the script, my wife played the main part, it was produced by Stan, it was filmed by his brother, and I have to tell you that what we decided to film was a story from a Dylan Thomas book, which... which was *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*, one of his portrait... no, that's... that's... is that the book? Anyway, it was a Dylan Thomas book of stories, and of course we tried to recreate this Welsh town in Johannesburg.
>
> None of us had ever been abroad, and so from this description... I can't even remember the story, I just wrote the script and the movie was made... it was actually shown. Bill Coker, John Coker's younger brother, played the lead part. Music was composed for it, but... and when I saw it and when I first came... when I then came to England and saw Wales, I just... I just began to realise how wrong we'd got everything, because to try and transform that... however, it was just the picture of the times that you'd try your hand at anything, you see, so we did lots of these things as students; it was all very exciting.

## 39. Passing the time with medicine

> I then... I had a good friend called Tony Allison at the time, who was doing science with me, and Le Gros Clark, who was professor of anatomy at Oxford, came out to South Africa in 1946 to see the anatomical remains – the palaeontological remains. And at this stage, he invited me to go back to Oxford to the anatomy department there, where I could continue to do science, because you... you must remember that a little bit later, Harold Daitz went to Le Gros Clark. So there were those connections between Dart and Le Gros Clark and... he also invited Tony Alison.
>
> I went to see Raymond Dart and said, 'What shall I do?' And Dart was a very wise man. He was at this time the Dean of the medical school, a great anatomist of the old school, had come from London, had seen Owen and all those people there. So, he said, 'Look, it sounds to me what you're interested in would be called biochemistry, but there are no jobs for people in biochemistry unless they are in medical schools, so what I advise you to do is to go back and finish medicine, and then you can become a biochemist'. And I took a lot of advice from people and everybody said... well, yeah, they agreed; there would be a dead end; there's no future in science as science at that time, because I'm talking about 1947; and the best thing is go back and finish medicine.
>
> So I had four years to do. So I stayed on in the department doing research and sort of did medicine part-time and... and what I did was I went on working there and used to just polish off the course in the last six weeks of the year, so... because I just was totally uninterested. The first year of going back wasn't too bad because we did pathology and bacteriology and that was still science, I did very well then. But then we started clinical work, and I... I just wasn't suited to that. I didn't like... I didn't like the whole structure of the teaching hospital; that is, I felt very much that treating patients as things is the wrong thing and that since I thought it was very hard to be a scientist and not do this, then I preferred not to do it at all.
>
> So in fact, I think I'm the only person who's ever passed medicine who had never seen a patient until his examination because I never went, and in fact one of the great stories is that I failed my medicine because I was asked to smell this patient's breath, incorrectly diagnosed Maclean's toothpaste, where I should have diagnosed acetone, you see; so the visiting professor from... the examining professor from Cambridge passed me... failed me.

## 40. Being the best in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

> However, I got the top first-class in obstetrics and gynaecology, and that was simply because you had to go and do this in residence, and at the time there was... you had to go into residence in a maternity hospital, and at the time of course all the students were trying to get into the white maternity hospital, Florence Nightingale, and be in the professor's firm to further their careers, and I didn't care where they sent me, and so I got a hospital right at the bottom of the list.
>
> It was a hospital in Durban, it was a black hospital and it was just on the Congella docks, and the four medical students who were all the kind of... you know, the leftovers, had this hotel room in this hotel where... let me just put it this way: amoebic dysentery was the mildest disease you could catch there. The rest of the hotel, as far as I could work out was taken up by ladies who entertained the sailors from the ship, and we had a telephone that connected us to the black hospital.
>
> There was nothing else to do except learn how to deliver babies and study obstetrics. So, since I had to do it, I managed to do it extremely well, and I learnt a lot about life that way and... being stuck out there. So that's part of the thing.

---

## 41. Scientific work undertaken during medical school

> But I went back... after this, I did another six months and finally passed medicine, but I had done research all along and published, in fact one of my papers that I published during this time involved getting down and synthesising a lot of dyes because I... I was interested in mitochondria and thought that the whole supravital staining of mitochondria was due to the oxidising enzymes there and the redox potential and so on. And so I synthesised a lot of dyes in the series... papers published, which differed... which were very similar, but differed in their redox potential and showed that only ones of these below a certain potential would be supravital stains, whereas all the others would be reduced and so bleached, and that's one of the things I did then.
>
> I also did another, which... which is an interesting experiment and which laid the basis for much of my later work, and it was a paper that showed that Claude's microsomal particles were the same as what the histologists were calling chromodial substance or ergastoplasm, which is they had to do with protein synthesis.
>
> Now I think what's interesting is the way I did this. Right, Claude had fractionated cells, these ribonucleic acid particles in an ultracentrifuge and had showed that they came to occupy a certain band in this, and they contained nucleic acid and they of course are the ribosomes as we now know them, the seat of protein synthesis. All the histologists had stained sections with dyes, of which the famous one was methyl-green pyronine, with a pyronine-stained chromodial substance or... or ergastoplasm, as it was called – red – and of course this... these were also supposed to be ribonucleic acid, but how could you tell if the particles were sub-microscopic – you couldn't see them.
>
> So what I did was: there were no ultracentrifuges, so I decided to use each cell as an ultracentrifuge and so I built a Beams and King air turbine ultracentrifuge, took pieces of liver, put them in this ultracentrifuge and spun them at this high velocity which I could get in an air driven turbine, and then cut sections of them so that each cell was like a little ultracentrifuge tube, and showed that the ergastoplasm sedimented in this cell to the same level that it did in a test-tube, above the glycogen, whatever.
>
> And there... I was very proud of that experiment... also led to something which I could write about later, the same experiment, which I published later, which was something called the Chromatic Nuclear Membrane, because I showed that there was chromatin that you couldn't spin off a nuclear membrane, which I believe is now coming back into fashion these days. But that was an interesting thing because it's the conception of translating one thing into the other...

*[Q] And then you stained them, of course?*

> Of course, I stained them, I cut sections, I embedded them. I stained them and found a lot of things with this and incidentally I... you know, I intend to use that again in my present research to try to concentrate the ribosome or particles in a cell for in situ localisation, this is just a very old technique. Now, I published that in 1948 in the South African Journal of Medical Sciences and was actually amazed, when I went to America, that people had read this and... and found, you know... so, that I would say is my first connection with what, you know, one would say is the modern molecular biology of ask... modern cell biology of trying to ask which are the parts of the cell doing this and I still think that that wasn't histochemistry.

## 42. Experiments: really finding things out

> Of course during this period every one of one's colleagues has always said that the book that influenced them most is *What Is Life*. A little book written by Erwin Schrödinger, which... you know, which people say: 'Were it not for Schrödinger, I would be playing the violin and collecting money on a... in an underground station in... in the tube'.
>
> And I actually read this book myself and in fact I have a copy here which you can see was bought in 1944, so I'd read this at a very early stage and I must say that I don't recall getting anything out of it in terms of what other people claim to have got, namely that it introduced them to the concept of the gene as a molecule and so on. I remember reading it as, as very interesting, of course I knew all about genes and chromosomes and this stuff seemed to me to be a bit amateur. I didn't understand the... the entropy part of the argument but in fact I have an inscription in my book which is a quotation from Faraday and, which said... says something and must be my... my impression of it at the time, and it says here:
>
> *"Let the imagination go, guarding it by judgement and principle, but holding it in and directing it by experiment."*
>
> So that is just the evidence it says... well, it's a great story but you know where are the experiments to tell you that it's true? And I think that that – which is written there, at the time – just says what... what this influenced me, and I think it's been very important, at least in my approach, which is that **you've got to really find out**.

---

## 43. Cambridge or Oxford?

> So during the course of my sort of dual career as a kind of reluctant medical student, together with being a practising scientist and I should say, also later on, a lecturer in physiology and a tutor all at the same time, I have come to the conclusion I've got to go abroad, and after the war, of course, many people did.
>
> I had already turned down this offer of Le Gros Clark but thought, this is really what I wanted to do, and in... I think it was 1948, Waddington came out to South Africa and... myself and a very good friend called George Clayton, and... were asked to look after him. We became responsible for this, Waddington was a great physiologist... embryologist and part of the school, and remained after that a friend for life. And he told me about Cambridge and all the interesting things that were going on in biochemistry in Cambridge. He had just moved to Edinburgh to start this – he said of course I could come to Edinburgh but if I wanted to go to Cambridge, that's where biochemistry was going.
>
> So I thought: well, I'll apply to Cambridge. So I applied; I wrote to Chibnall, who was then the professor, and I never got a reply.
>
> In the meantime, the principal of my university, Humphrey Raikes, a very great man, I had told him that I really wanted to go to England; I wanted to do this. So he said to me, 'Well there is a man at Oxford who is interested in these things; he's called Hinshelwood', because it turned out that Humphrey Raikes was a physical chemist at Oxford and knew about Hinshelwood, and his college was Exeter College and Hinshelwood was a... he... he was Dr Lee's Professor of Physical Chemistry there, and Hinshelwood had written a book called *The Chemical Kinetics of the Bacterial Cell*.

---

## 44. Hunting for future-proof sciences

> I was very active in hunting around as a naive young man for those sciences that could stand me in good stead for the future, which is a ludicrous activity. You know, you kind of say, 'Well, look, I think it's going to be topology that's going to give you the breakthrough', so you go and learn topology, you see. And I had been through things like rheology – I had a great passion on rheology – and I knew everything about thixotropy and rheopexy because I thought trying to find out all about the physical chemistry of cytoplasm wasn't a bad idea and I knew it would have something to do with physical chemistry.

*[Q] Did you have a clear formulation of the problem in your mind?*

> No, I... I just knew that, you know, we had to get in there and do things. I think, at this stage the concept of information as separate from matter had not yet crystallised; that crystallised during this period prior to my going by reading von Neumann and my contacts with Seymour Papert, but I realised that this whole idea that the genes have to carry information and that there was no explanation of that.

*[Q] You came to that before you went? Could you just explain...*

> Yes, yes, in fact I had a theory of protein synthesis before I went to Oxford.

*[Q] I'm afraid you must explain this a little bit.*

> Yeah. So what had happened was I then applied to... to Hinshelwood and was accepted; I read his book *The Chemical Kinetics of the Bacterial Cell*. It's full of equations. It didn't say too much about the stuff that was going on there, which I realised was the important thing, but in the meantime... and I won one of these Royal Commissions for the Exhibition of 1851 Scholarships. There was only one a year to South Africa... for South Africa, and I won it and Seymour got it I think... his... a year or two later and that brought him to Cambridge. This was a great set of scholarships and so that got me to Oxford.
>
> But prior to this I had started to grapple with this business with the coding problem, as it's known now, and I got... I read Astbury's paper because I was an assiduous reader of... of symposia. I decided symposia tell you a lot of things and so I read all these articles there because... reading the literature in the sense we know it now. And I read an Astbury in the *Society for Experimental Biology* – the English one, symposium there – in which he pointed out this relationship between the step size of nucleic acid, 3.3Å units, and the step size of amino acids, 3.5Å units, and had discussed there about the amino acids being determined by the nucleic acid. There... yes, it's very early. Okay.
>
> And so... and Dounce of course had already written such coding papers. And in fact later I learnt that Hinshelwood had written a coding paper and there was a ferment of business and so I had actually developed, before I went to Oxford, an idea that in fact nucleic acids and amino acid and proteins were co-synthesised through aminoacyl nucleotide intermediates and I'd had the naive idea that they came in this way and in fact the... the base was joined to make a nucleic acid because we knew all that chemistry; had no idea about base pairing. And at the same time the amino acid was joined to make this and it was very crude... idea, but in fact I had a mechanism – what was very hot at that time was actophosphate bonds, and high energy phosphate bonds, and this seemed to me to fit pretty well and I had these great ideas that this is how you make proteins and specify them.

---

## 45. John von Neumann and the history of DNA and self-replication

> What influenced me the most was the articles of von Neumann. Now, I had become interested in von Neumann not through the coding issues but through his interest in the nervous system and computers and of course, that's what Seymour was interested in because what we wanted to do is find out how the brain worked; that was what... you know, like a hobby on the side, you know. After... after dinner we'd work on central problems of the brain, you see, but it was trying to find out how this worked.
>
> And so I got this symposium, the Hixon Symposium, which I had got to read. I was, at that time, very fascinated by a rather strange complexion of psychology things by a man called Wolfgang Köhler who was a gestalt psychologist and another man called Lewin, who was what was called a topological psychologist and of course they were talking at a very different level, but in this book there is an article by Köhler and of course in that book there's this very famous paper which no one has ever read of von Neumann.
>
> Now of course later I discovered that those ideas were much older than the dating of this and that people had taken notes of them and they had circulated. But what is the brilliant part of this paper is in fact his description of what it takes to make a self-reproducing machine. And in fact if you look at what he says and what Schrödinger says, you can see what I have come to call **Schrödinger's fundamental error**, and in fact we can... I can find you the passage in that.
>
> But it's an amazing passage, because what von Neumann shows is that you have to have a mechanism not only of copying the machine but of copying the information that specifies the machine, right, so that he then divided the machine – the... the automaton as he called it – into three components: the functional part of the automaton; a... a decoding section of this which is part of that, which actually takes the tape, reads the instructions and builds the automaton; and a device that takes a copy of this tape and inserts it into the new automaton, right, which is the essential... essential, fundamental...
>
> And when von Neumann said that is the logical basis of self-reproduction, then you can see where Schrödinger made his mistake and this can be summarised in one sentence. **Schrödinger says the chromosomes contain the information to specify the future organism and the means to execute it and that's not true. The chromosomes contain the information to specify the future organisation and a description of the means to implement, but not the means themselves**, and that logical difference is made so crystal clear by von Neumann and that to me, was in fact...
>
> The first time now of course, I wasn't smart enough to really see that this is what DNA is all about, and of course it is one of the ironies of this entire field that were you to write a history of ideas in the whole of DNA, simply from the documented information as it exists in the literature, that is a kind of Hegelian history of ideas, you would certainly say that Watson and Crick depended on von Neumann, because von Neumann essentially tells you how it's done and then you just... DNA is just one of the implementations of this. But of course, none knew anything about the other, and so it's a... it's a great paradox to me that in fact this connection was not seen.
>
> Linus Pauling is present at that meeting because he gives this False Theory of Antibodies there. That means he heard von Neumann, must have known von Neumann, but he couldn't put that together with DNA and of course... well, neither could Linus Pauling put his own paper together with his future work because he and Delbrück wrote a paper on self... on self-complementation – two pieces of information – in about 1949 and had forgotten it by the time he did DNA, so that of course leads to a really distrust about what all the historians of science say, especially those of the history of ideas.
>
> But I think that that in a way is part of our kind of revolution in thinking, namely the whole of the theory of computation, which I think biologists have yet to assimilate and yet is there and it's a... it's an amazingly paradoxical field. You know, most fields start by struggling through from, from experimental confusion through early theoretical, you know, self-delusion, finally to the great generality and this field starts the other way round. It starts with a total abstract generality, namely it starts with, with Gödel's hypothesis or the Turing machine, and then it takes, you know, 50 years to descend into... into banality, you see. So it's the field that goes the other way and that is again remarkable, you know, and they cross each other at about 1953, you know: von Neumann on the way down, Watson and Crick on the way up. It was never put together.

*[Q] But... but you didn't put it together either?*

> I didn't put it together, but I did put together a little bit later that, because the moment I saw the DNA molecule, then I knew it.

*[Q] And you connected the two at once?*

> I knew this.

## 46. Schrödinger wrong, von Neumann right

> I think he made a fundamental error, and the fundamental error can be seen in his idea of what the chromosome contained. He says... in describing what he calls the code script, he says, "The chromosome structures are at the same time instrumental in bringing about the development they foreshadow. They are law code and executive power, or to use another simile, they are the architect's plan and the builder's craft in one." And in our modern parlance, we would say, "They not only contain the program but the means to execute the program". And that is wrong, because they don't contain the means; they only contain a description of the means to execute it.
>
> Now the person that got it right and got it right before DNA is von Neumann in developing the logic of self-reproducing automata which was based of course on Turing's previous idea of automaton and he gives this description of this automaton which has one part that is the machine; this machine is built under the instructions of a code script, that is a program and of course there's another part to the machine that actually has to copy the program and insert a copy in the new machine. So he very clearly distinguishes between the things that read the program and the program itself.
>
> In other words, **the program has to build the machinery to execute the program** and in fact he says it's... when he tries to talk about the biological significance of this abstract theory, he says: "This automaton E has some further attractive sides, which I shall not go into at this time at any length".

---

## 47. Schrödinger's belief in calculating an organism from chromosomes

> One of the central things in the Schrödinger's little book *What Is Life* is what he has to say about the chromosomes containing the program or the code, and he says here... on page 20, he says: "In calling the structure of the chromosome fibres a code script, we mean that the all penetrating mind once conceived by Laplace, to which every cause or connection lay immediately open, could tell from their structure whether the egg would develop under suitable conditions, into a black cock, or into a speckled hen, into a fly, or a maize plant, a rhododendron, a beetle, a mouse or a woman".
>
> Now, apart from the list of organisms he has given, which falls short of a serious classification of the living world, what he is saying here is that if you could look at the chromosomes, you could compute the... you could calculate the organism, but he's saying something more. He's saying that you could actually implement the organism because he goes on to add: "But the term code script is of course too narrow. The chromosome structures are at the same time instrumental in bringing about the development they foreshadow. They are law code and executive power, or to use another simile they are architect's plan and builder's craft in one."
>
> What he is saying here is that the chromosomes not only contain a description of the future organism but the means to implement that description or program as we might call it. That's wrong, because they don't contain the means to implement it, they only contain a description of the means to implement it and that distinction was made absolutely crystal clear by this remarkable paper of von Neumann, in which he develops and in fact provides a proof of what a self-reproducing automaton – or machine – would have to... would have to contain in order to satisfy the requirements of self-reproduction.
>
> He develops this concept of course from the earlier concept of Turing, who had developed ideas of automata that operated on tapes and which of course gave a mechanical example of how you might implement some computation. And if you like, this is the beginning of the theory of computation and what von Neumann has to say about this is made very clear in this essay.
>
> And he says that you've got to have several components, and I'll just summarise them. He said you first start with an automaton A, "which, when furnished this description of any other automaton in terms of the appropriate functions, will construct that entity". It's like a Turing machine, you see. So automaton A has to be given a tape and then it'll make another automaton A, all right.
>
> Now what you have, you've got to have... add to this automaton B. "Automaton B can make a copy of any instruction I that is furnished to it", so if you give it a program, it'll copy the program. And then you have... you combine A and B with each other and you give a control mechanism C, that you have to add as well, which does the following. It says, "Let A be furnished with the instruction I". So you give... you give the tape to A, A copies it under the control of C, okay, by every description, so it makes another copy of A, then you... and of course B is part of A. Then you... C then tells B, "copy this tape I", gives B the copying part of it, this copies it and then C will then take the tape I, and put it into the new machine, okay, and turns it loose as he says here, "as an independent entity".

## 48. Automata akin to living cells

> Von Neumann noted that "the instruction I is roughly effecting the functions of a gene" and that "the copying mechanism B performs the fundamental act of reproduction, the duplication of the genetic material."
>
> Von Neumann proposed these ideas in the late 1940s, published in early 1952. Despite their accuracy, these concepts had minimal impact on the biological community, possibly due to cultural differences between physicists/mathematicians and biologists.

## 49. Biology doesn't allow for relaxing baths

> The trouble with theory in biology is it's not like that in physics, there's no way you can use it. You see... I mean, Leó Szilárd used to tell me that the one thing that happened when he went into biology is he couldn't take a nice bath. When he was a physicist, he could go into a bath and he could lie there for three hours and he could think about physics, but he said when he went into biology, no sooner did he get in the bath then he'd have to get out and look up another fact. So he was always unable then to take a... a relaxed bath, and I think that is the nature, because you have to ask yourself, who... you know, what had this all been about, because this is one of those remarkable things in biology that is, you know, absolutely true, yet absolutely vacuous.
>
> There's nothing you can do about it. I mean, it tells you how things might work; it doesn't tell you how you can make a mouse. That's in the end... we're always preoccupied with these questions of detail. So that's... but I think, you know, having had this connection with this kind of thinking, having, you know, tried to teach myself enough mathematics at least to be able to deal with a mathematical argument, but I think, you know, the thing that I've always realised I'm much better at is actually, you know, **doing the real thing in a lab**.

## 50. Work on phage with Hinshelwood in Oxford

> What happened when I got to Oxford, as I saw Hinshelwood... and I had discovered this book *Viruses*, 1950, a little symposium held at Cal Tech and I'd read about phage. And... bacteriophage. And Hinshelwood was then working on drug resistance in bacteria and so he wrote to me and said he'd like me to work on bacteriophage resistance, to show it's an adaptation. I had read about phage and got very excited by *Viruses*. It's a remarkable book, that *Viruses*, 1950.

*[Q] Who's it by?*

> It was a symposium at Cal Tech; it's by various people and it is the beginnings of the... the phage... phage ideas there, you know, and really what is a virus? I mean... which you know was going to become clear in the next 20 years.
>
> And so I started to work on bacteriophage and I started to read about them. Hinshelwood wanted me to work on resistance because he was a great believer in the time that bacteria adapted to certain situations and then what was inherited was in fact the adapted state and he didn't believe in mutation. Strictly speaking, he said that the evidence that people had didn't support the idea that there were mutants. That was his... his thing.
>
> Now, I think in modern language we will see that those ideas are pretty common today, like we don't call it inheritance, we can say the persistence of, or the descent of, a certain determined state, which is not because there's been a gene mutation, but because there's a self-perpetuating state. And of course, he came in, he was very... he was very controversial, and so I started to work on bacteriophage resistance in a physical chemistry lab which was totally unequipped to do any biological work.
>
> We had to... we were given a pressure cooker and thirty glass petri dishes and some pipettes and you had to make your own petri dishes and all the pipettes were Pasteur pipettes which you had to plug yourself, and sterilise in an oven. And so each experiment became a logistic effort and amongst other experiments that I did – it's all in my DPhil thesis – is I repeated the Luria-Delbrück fluctuation experiments. I think I'm the only person in the world who's repeated them because Hinshelwood didn't believe... didn't believe in them. And I repeated them, and this got me into the whole area of genetics of mutations and so on, and I started to work on the side, on other problems.
>
> What I wanted to work on was lysogeny because I thought that would... Hinshelwoodian theories could easily explain lysogeny – that is, the switch between lysogenic and lytic – and what he was doing was trying to explain resistance. And I'll never forget... and I tried to explain it to him at the end, I said to him... I said, 'Professor, in science as in life, it is important to distinguish between chastity and impotence. The outcome is the same, the reasons are fundamentally different.' Okay.
>
> So... that I've used... this is a very important... it's a difference between can't and won't basically. So, mutation says you're bacteriophage resistant, because you lose a receptor to bind the bacteriophage; that is impotence, okay? Now the other is you choose to be chaste, you see, so that can be done by a... a thing like this, and so that I think is a very important way of doing it.
>
> However, I was the first person in that group who ever argued with him. It was absolutely unheard of, that one would actually challenge the professor, because we were still in those days you know where the Herr Geheimrat was right at the top and actually I got on extremely well with him and in fact, you know, just argued with him. And... but he was someone who, if you could show him an experiment, that was the thing that convinced him, and I think at the end of the day he was willing to think that some things were due to mutation.

*[Q] But you were the only biologist there?*

> I was the only person with a biological background. Other people were kind of chemists that had done this.

## 51. Taking advantage of Oxford University

> But in the meantime, I took advantage of Oxford. For example, I had to go and get phages, so I got them from across the road in the pathology department when I met some people there that were working on phage as phage... were working for Sir Paul Fildes, who was a member of the old school of microbiologists, you know; came every morning to the lab in a bowler hat and striped car... trousers and so on – a very nice man. One of the important people for antimetabolites, the whole background of, you know, sulphonamides and so on, and what that led to, and I got to know them, and I got to know some people there; I got to know people in the biochemistry department, because I had to learn about bacteria.
>
> I actually got to know people in the organic chemistry department because I had discovered that some phage mutants were also tryptophan deficient. That had been known, but I got one of these and I decided to go and find out why they were, so I started to work on tryptophan biosynthesis and I got a theory of what might be happening, if I had to go and make one of the intermediates. And so I went across to the Dyson Perrins Laboratory where I got hold of a bench and was doing there.
>
> One morning, Sir Robert Robertson... Robertson swept in and started to ask me what I was doing, got very interested in, and I couldn't explain to him that I was a... an intruder and apparently, about a week later, he came in and asked where this interesting person had gone, because I'd done my work and disappeared and so... but in fact, again, you see, that is very interesting because if you want to... I needed these intermediates; you couldn't get them anywhere, so the best thing is to go and make them. I mean, how do you make them, you get hold of a paper and it says, you know, take two teaspoonfuls of this compound and stir well in, so I did it, you see, and I made it, I crystallised it, but **this is something you can always do... it's open to you. There's no magic in this** and I think the whole of the philosophy that says unless you've gone through this way, if you're an old chap of 25, you can't do it. What you have to be is 18 and naive and go to a course and learn how to do it. This is just absolutely untrue.

## 52. Professor Dawkins and "Quest for Corvo"

> So I spent two years at Oxford, and of course being A, a scientist; B, a colonial, never really participated in the Oxford scene except for one rather interesting man that I met and my... Humphrey Raikes said to me I must go and meet Professor Dawkins, whom he remembered as an undergraduate. Now, one of the books that I became... I was very impressed with reading, was a book called *Quest for Corvo* by AJA Symons, and this is about a complete sort of, strange man who... I mean, the book has to be read really. Corvo was his pen name; I've forgotten his...

*[Q] CH Rolfe.*

> Rolfe, yes. F Rolfe, not CH Rolfe.

*[Q] Yes, sorry, you're right.*

> Yes, and he believed he was destined for greater things and should be a cardinal. He became famous in the seventies; he wrote a book called *Hadrian the Seventh*, one of his novels. But one of the people that sheltered him was Dawkins, who was then Head of the British School in Rome *[sic]* and he had later become professor of Medieval Greek at Oxford, and when I came to meet him he was very old and retired and I used to go and have tea with Dawkins every now and then. In fact, we once had him to dinner, and I still have in my... my possession a letter that he wrote to me. He had a typewriter with half the keys missing so that the letter would be typed and all the missing letters then filled in by hand.
>
> He... he was very interesting because I listened for hours to the stories of these strange... this strange sort of literary activities of... of this... because, as you know, they formed a Corvo Society where they read papers. AJA Symons, who had written about this man was also another strange man; who was the founder of the Food and Wine Society, collected music boxes which he left, and a brilliant biography of AJA Symons who was equally a phoney as was Corvo, was written by his brother, Julian Symons, the detective novelist.
>
> So this had the thing. And of course, when I got to King's College and our... one of our old provosts, Sheppard – Sheppard was an old crony of Dawkins – and so, again, I got... re-turned the wheel and listened to these wonderful stories of going to Monte Carlo, you know, in the '20s to gamble, where you actually went on the Blue train and left your boots outside to be polished, but the concept of wearing boots to Monte Carlo just seems today so bizarre in the extreme. However, this is so... you know, because I love these connections, you know, that start from nowhere and sort of bring these two worlds that you only read about in books together. So *Quest for Corvo* is worthwhile reading because it's a literary thing.

## 53. The Surprise of England

> Coming to Oxford was of course a great surprise in many ways, and one had... I had an image of England which was completely distorted, and of course I... that, one realised as this... as the boat docked at Southampton, on a very cold morning and I looked out, everything was much smaller than I had imagined it to be. Of course, coming from South Africa, where distances were enormous, the whole idea that things that were far away were 30 miles apart was... was... came as a surprise and of course coming to Oxford on that day and... was again a surprise to me, and a shock in a way because I had come to learn of the death of Harold Daitz on that very day.
>
> However, I did settle down. I got myself digs as they were, with... in Herne Road. Of course, there was food rationing in England which I hadn't... couldn't understand, and so I had to give all my landlady all my points for meat so that I could have a breakfast there, and the important people that I met in Oxford... and of course Oxford was not very interested in scientists at the time; scientists were second-class citizens; and of course colonials were in the second division of the second-class.
>
> And so one's social life was quite restrained – had almost nothing to do with the university – but there had been set up in Oxford for the benefit of scientists a kind of postgraduate club called Halifax House and it is through that... it was just across the road from the physical chemistry laboratory where I worked and through that that I met **Jack Dunitz**.

## 54. My secret input into the DNA model

> Now, Jack Dunitz was a crystallographer, and he had been at Cal Tech until he had returned to Oxford to work in... in Dorothy Hodgkin's laboratory. And it is Jack who knew Pauling and Jack and I had many discussions and started discussing things including my ideas about DNA and... DNA and how to determine the structure of DNA which was just complete nonsense I should say, because my idea was that you did it by... by binding dyes to it – proflavine – and then look at ultraviolet dichroism and I thought you might be able to crystallise it with a dye.
>
> I also through... through Jack met Leslie Orgel who was also at Oxford, a theoretical chemist, and we started a little group of meetings in which I talked to them about genetics and of course I learnt a little bit about structure from them. And it was through Jack later that I heard... I heard in about November of that year – this is November 1952... I heard through Jack of this idea of Francis Crick about helical diffraction. It was a paper that Francis published prior to the DNA which is *The Theory of Helical Diffraction [sic]*, and which of course leads to the interpretation of the X-ray structure.
>
> One interesting sidelight that... was that I was visited in January of that year, of the next year, or sometime around that, but certainly prior to the publication of the DNA structure, by Jerry Donohue. Jerry Donohue was a friend of Jack's and he came to visit me in the physical chemistry library and we were talking about the DNA bases, and I just drew one of them and he said, 'Why do you draw it this way?' And I said to him, 'Because I've always drawn it this way. This is the way I've seen it in the books that I have read.'
>
> Now, it's quite interesting; I mean, I can't say that there was a direct connection, but it was Jerry that pointed out to the people that they were using the incorrect tautomer and it is a... and I had found this and of course I... I had it in a... in a paper. Most people drew the bases in the OH form. Of course, that's the wrong form, rather than in the Keto form which is the correct form to see the base pairing, so it may have been a little bit of input prior to... to that as well and it was just... I mean, I didn't have any profound chemical understanding, I just simply... just always looked at it this way and didn't think of it in any other form.

## 55. The DNA model: the beginning of molecular biology

> Of course the most important thing that happened there is that Jack Dunitz then told me... we heard about all the developments with DNA because Jack was following it, and he told me that Francis Crick and Jim Watson had solved the structure of DNA and that... and we decided to go across to see it, and this was in April of 1953.
>
> Jack and I and Leslie and another crystallographer went to Cambridge, and that's where I met Jim Watson and Francis Crick, and that's where I saw the DNA model for the first time, in the Cavendish, and **that's when I saw that this was it. In a flash you could just see that everything... you know, this is... this was the fundamental... the curtain had been lifted and everything was now clear what to do.**
>
> And I got tremendously excited by this, and saw that one was justified. Of course I was working on phage, and Jim had worked on phage, and of course both of us had done extremely trivial work on bacteriophage. He did radiation sensitivity and I of course was doing absorption and mutation, but I think that it was coming through that and through Jack getting the contact with Cal Tech and via that with Francis and with Jim.
>
> I spent that... I talked a lot to Francis on that day but I spent most of the day talking to Jim and walking around with him and I just knew that **this is the... this was really the beginning of molecular biology. This was it**, and sort of all the... the rather simple ideas that I was fumbling through, you know, just now reached immediate clarification.
>
> So I then decided that of course this is exactly what one must work on, and I went back to Oxford. I kept up... I kept correspondence with Jim, and Jim came to visit me later that year – that's in 1953. He came there, and he came on July 6th, and I know that because my... my youngest... my stepson, who was then seven, had a party, and of course what happens that Jim ate all the cake then. Jim was a great lover of desserts, and of course they were all terribly impressed by his appetite for... for cake. And Jim of course had come... Jim had other friends like Av Mitchison that he'd come to see in Oxford, and so I kept that up and when that had gone... of course, Francis had gone to America later in '53.

## 56. Crick, Watson and the first model of the double helix

> We went to Cambridge, and we went by car. It was a small car. It was very cold I remember, and the car wasn't heated. No one had heaters in cars. And we must have arrived in Cambridge in the late morning at, say, 11, or this. We went into the Austin Wing of the Cavendish Laboratory; I went in with Jack and Leslie, and we went into the room that was lined with brick, and there on the side there, I can remember was this small... was this model made of all the plate and the plates for the bases, and the... this is the original model with everything was screwed together, and I could see the double helix there.
>
> And Francis was sitting there – it's the first time that I met him – and of course he couldn't stop talking. And he just went on and on and on and on, and it was very inspiring, you see. And they talked really about... more about the second paper. See, Jim stood there, and Jim, I had the feeling was get... he was there at his desk in that room, which I came to occupy later when I came to the Cavendish. And Jim was... Jim was saying... well, you know, just interspersing, and of course I got talking more to Jim later on. Francis had to go somewhere, but I spent the rest of the day with Jim.
>
> Now, the... what we talked about mostly was... not was... not the structure itself, but of the biological implications. Namely that which appeared in the second paper, which of course at that stage neither papers had appeared. This was prior. The paper appeared in May, so the paper was expected in a few weeks. The second paper appeared a little later than that.

---

## 57. The first and second DNA structure papers

> The first paper defined the structure with the famous closing line: "It has not escaped our attention." It was published alongside the Wilkins-Franklin research, so it focused purely on structure.
>
> The second paper, however, addressed the biological implications—discussing replication, chain unwinding, mutation mechanisms involving tautomers, and code questions. Most people at the time believed unwinding the chains "looks impossible," which created a conceptual obstacle.
>
> I introduced the concept of a **"Don't Worry hypothesis"**—proposing one plausible mechanism (in this case, an enzyme to unwind chains) without requiring complete proof before proceeding with theory development. This approach is "very important in biology" because it permits productive theoretical work despite apparent difficulties.
>
> Rejecting problems outright as "impossible" stifles progress, whereas acknowledging potential solutions allows investigation to continue. The unwinding problem exemplifies this: helicases—enzymes that break and rejoin DNA chains—eventually confirmed the theoretical framework.

---

## 58. The real concept of the DNA code

> But that's also the first time when I saw that... I saw the real concept of the code there. Now that I think is the remarkable thing. That is that there were these two one-dimensional sequences, and **it is the reduction of biology to one dimension in terms of information that is the absolute crucial step**.
>
> Biology... biology had been three-dimensional, and a lot of people wanted it four-dimensional. But the whole idea that you could reduce it to one dimension is a very powerful idea. That you can just have linear sequences. Because it just makes the disentangling of everything so much easier to understand, makes copying easy to understand, it makes expression easy to understand, it makes the mapping easy to understand, and makes mutation easy to understand.
>
> And in fact once you've got this absolutely clear-cut conception, then you know, in this very small evangelical sect you realise that everybody else was talking nonsense.

---

## 59. Understanding the DNA model

> Well, I had been grappling to this, that there were things that you'd have to do, because I had had ideas that you synthesised DNA, nucleic acid and protein together. So to me this was okay. You know, I had the ideas of one-dimensional sequences, and of course I was very much intrigued by computers and the von Neumann thing, these are one-dimensional sequences as well; tapes, the Turing machine is a one-dimensional sequence.
>
> And so all of this, this whole idea of the embodying of information in this, is in fact a... an important and fundamental breakthrough in my opinion, and to see that... because... and also to get away from mechanism. See, at that time all the biochemists of the world were preoccupied, as where do you get the energy to make proteins? And we had to spend weeks, months saying, **'Don't worry about the energy, energy will look after itself; the important thing is how do you get everything in the correct order? How do you get everything to be specified in this order?'** That is, the genetic code is the thing.
>
> So I think that this is such an important and fundamental divergence from anything else in biology that it is, you know, a total discontinuity – at least this is the way that I've seen it – and it has of course constrained quite a lot of later developments in biology. And of course crystallises the actual problems you have to solve in a very clear-cut way, because now they do not remain sort of vague problems that... that you can just ask almost rhetorical questions about, but you can actually sit down and say, 'If I had a gene that I could do the fine structure, and if I had a protein that I could sequence, then I could show whether or not the gene was co-linear'.

---

## 60. Impressions of Watson and Crick

> My impression of Jim Watson was of this rather eccentric, bright person who seemed to be... didn't pay as much attention to me as I would have liked, and walked very rapidly, with long strides – because we went for a walk. And someone who knew all the people. You see, you have to realise that Jim... Jack Dunitz was my first meeting with someone who knew Delbrück, you see. So it... it's interesting, that – to see people that when you meet people who knew other people for the first time, this is quite interesting. Jack knew Pauling, you see. And you see, now here's Franc... here's Watson, Watson knew... knew Luria; I knew Luria's work, I was doing Delbrück-Luria experiments. To actually meet the people that had experiments named after them.
>
> See, in those days you know, we used to contemplate what made people famous. And we realised that in chemistry you had to have a piece of apparatus named after you. So today we remember Büchner by his funnel, Erlenmeyer by his flask and Liebig by his condenser, you see. In mathematics you have to have a theorem, or better still a lemma. And of course in biology, we didn't know what you had to have named after you. And so, you know, we... we contemplated what it was; you have a theory, of course. Later we found out what it... **you had a system**. An *in vitro* system. So there was the Nirenberg system. And this idea of having an... a system to do something was exemplified when much later I defined the rabbit as a system into which you put an antigen and from which you get an antibody, you see. So that was the idea. So that has gone now, I'm glad to say.
>
> Well, Francis, I... I just have not such... I mean, I was very impressed by his... the way he spoke. And by his enthusiasm. And of course you see, Francis had been a cell biologist, and he had studied viscosity with magnets. And that was... that interested me also, because I'd looked at those papers, you see, as well. Later on of course, so I just heard a bit about this, but no, I mean, Francis I had heard about before I met him as a crystallographer from Jack Dunitz. And as the forerunner of the interpreter of the helical diffraction.

---

## 61. Enzymologists reject the model of DNA

> The model wasn't accepted at all. You see, the... at that stage, you had the establishment. The establishment were all the biochemists, the big guys in... the big men in the world – people like Fritz Lipmann; there were all the people that were... Lynen, you know – all the people doing enzymology. The big man in this country was Tommy Work, who was trying to work on protein synthesis.
>
> And I think that this whole idea that you could have a structure which is a theory, that you could go from this theory to something that was biology, that you could do all these things like genetics, they didn't think... and as you know, I mean, **Chargaff just said that molecular biologists were people who practised biochemistry without a licence**.
>
> And in fact I remember one occasion – which was a little later than the period – where Francis had put forward the idea of the adaptor hypothesis. The adaptor hypothesis postulated that for each amino acid there'd be an RNA... well there'd be an adaptor, which we... later became the RNA, and there'd be one enzyme to join the two together. And the biochemists said, 'This is utterly impossible because... that there are going to be 20 enzymes to do this, because had they existed we biochemists would have already have discovered them, and we haven't, so it must be wrong'.

---

## 62. The fusion of genetics and biochemistry

> Well, I think the other most important thing was in fact the fusion of genetics and biochemistry, and it's worthwhile just looking back as to what a mess genetics got into. At the turn of the century, when genetics had become an established science, many people went into genetics because the problems they were working with were insoluble. And the most important one is TH Morgan. TH Morgan started life as an embryologist, and which he found intractable. And he has written in his book *Regeneration* that in fact... he turned to genetics because this would give him a new entry into development.
>
> And most of the early geneticists did that. To try to find genes and the mechanisms of these... of this. By the beginning of the war – that is after the first biochemical genetics in drosophila had been done, that is the eye colour – it had become clear that it... it was extremely difficult to get any deeper than just finding a mutant and finding out what it does. That is the purely descriptive level.
>
> And that is why when people started to work with neurospora, Beadle and Tatum started to do biochemical genetics, this immediately attracted people like Ephrussi and attracted people Jacques Monod into this, and of course by 1945 we had this idea that what genes do is control biochemical processes. And there it got stuck, and organismal genetics up to that time, beyond that time, had gone in the direction of population genetics.
>
> So it is the fusion of biochemistry and genetics that I think represented another thing which was completely absent at the time and that you could actually think of experiments which were designed to test the hypothesis. You could say, 'If this controls this enzyme, then it follows that if I get such and such a mutant the following would happen'. And that was such a remarkably interesting thing to be able to do in biology.
>
> And of course working with bacteriophage was very interesting, because I remember someone asked me, 'What statistical test do you use for significance?' You see, because normally in biochemistry you would do a subject by estimating the amount of calcium in the blood of an animal under different experimental conditions, then you do statistics to see if the differences were significant. And so I remember I said to him, **'We don't do any statistics... oh, I'm sorry, we do have one test. We plot our results on seven-cycle log paper – that is it goes over 10^7 – and you hold the sheet at one end of the room, and you stand at the other end of the room, and if you can see a difference it's significant'**.

*[Q] Sorry Sydney, why... why did you not do statistics? Because the results were so clear-cut?*

> Well, they were... they were a thousand times, a million times. And let me just go back to this thing, you see, because the other thing was **genetics is digital; it's all or none**. We didn't have to make any quantitative measurements. And when you think about it, it's very remarkable subject, or was at that time. That is, if you're testing a recombinant, either you get a recombinant or you don't. Later on you can actually measure how much recombination. But you can do everything by one and zero. You can actually do yes/no. And you can then do very remarkable results, very remarkable experiments, just on this, these very simple Boolean primitives in a way that you could not do in any other subject.

## 63. The power of luck and ignorance

> Jim has said that he was lucky. He said, 'You need a bit of luck'. Well, you do; everybody can do with luck – luck helps. But it's hard to say. I mean, you know, I've always said for myself that I was lucky to have been born at the right time, to have come to the right place, to have had my background and to have met the right people, you know, at the right time.
>
> And I think you could even argue that good luck can make bad scientists good. You know, bad luck can make... bad luck doesn't help anybody but good luck can be the mark of a... of a good scientist. So I think it's that.
>
> But it's actually... it's actually what I think is that certain subjects reach a certain stage and what they require is someone come and look at them from a completely different point of view. And **I'm a great believer in the power of ignorance. I think you can always know too much**. I feel one of the things of being an experienced scientist in a subject is it curtails creativity, because you know too much and you know what won't work.
>
> And I think what we should be doing is **spreading ignorance rather than knowledge**, because it's ignorance that allows you to do things. And so I believe that it is people who come from the outside, who have not been entrained into the standard approach, who can see things from a different way. Those I think are the people who will then make the new step.
>
> You see, because Gamow didn't know anything about molecular structure, he couldn't even... but he saw these from the point of view of... of a physicist, of a correspondence, which is what physicists dealed with, and he could pose the problem in a form that no biochemists could pose it, because that's not the way they thought.

---

## 64. Seymour Benzer

> Well, Seymour's a remarkable person. Seymour was trained as a physicist; Seymour was in fact an important person in the invention in the Transistor in his early work. He started that... he started working in solid state physics. And Seymour decided he would go into biology and wanted to learn this, and so the best thing he could do as a physicist was to go and work at Oak Ridge – the atomic energy – where the only thing he could work on was radiation, and by... and that's how he got into phage.
>
> But Seymour is a person who's come from things from the outside, and has the ingenuity of being able to formulate experiments and... and you know, carry them out...

---

## 65. Physicists preparing for biology

> On the other hand, those who came from physics and thought that they would find a new physics in biology just got lost in the metaphysical jungle, for the simple reason that, you know, biology is very low energy physics – that it's got... of course it's consistent with the laws of physics, otherwise if we weren't we wouldn't be here, and it's just chemistry... part of chemistry in a very particular mode. So I think many of the earlier discussions of the physicists were irrelevant.
>
> And I also think that what is another thing that's remarkable is **you can't prepare yourself, as I mistakenly believed as a young person, equip yourself with a theoretical apparatus for the future**. You know, so you learn group theories saying... could be important, or lattice algebra, and go around looking for such other tools, because I think it's good to know what there is. But I don't think you can, so to speak, equip yourself, because I think things take you from the back basically and surprise you.
>
> And someone once told me, 'What mathematics do I need to'... asked me, 'What mathematics do I need to do biology?' I said, **'The ability to count up to 20, that's all. You don't need much more from that. It's 20 amino acids, four bases, you might have to go to 64 at some stage, but you don't need much more than that.'**
>
> So I think that that's another interesting thing where we are mistaken in how we prepare ourselves, you know, for our heroic voyages of the future. **The best thing to do a heroic voyage is just start. Don't... don't equip yourself.**

## 66. Scientific interaction with Francis Crick

> Yes, I think that Francis had... has always had the ability to crystallise the questions in a remarkable... in a remarkable way. That is, he has formulated... and I of course, I have spent in later life, I spent 20 years sharing an office, I had many, many conversations with him.
>
> There were always two things that I think were important about our conversations was **never restrain yourself; say it, even if it is completely stupid and ridiculous and wrong, because just uttering it gets it out into the open**. And someone else will pick up something from it. And I think the people who will not say anything until they've got it fully worked out, and there are people like this, these are people who don't have what I consider to be the most important thrill about doing... science is the kind of social interaction, the kind of companionship that comes from two people's minds playing on each other. And I think that that's the most important thing: say it, even if it is stupid.
>
> And the second thing is... which is important, is that, at least in... in... for myself, in... in such... in such thing, is **always try... I've always tried to materialise the question in the form of: well, if it is like this, how would you go about doing anything about it?** So I've always tried to think of some experiment or... or somewhere where... where might get... one get hold of the information to test this.
>
> And Francis has always had that kind of... at least we've always had that interaction of this, and of course he is a very severe audience; you don't get away with things, you have to... you have to be thinking all the time, because he asks very penetrating questions.
>
> And, of course, one of the other things that I learnt through these interactions was to **get the scale of everything right**. It's very important; this is not... this is not done. You know, and you can tell by the drawings. For example, you know, very early on we realised that the amount of DNA in a bacterium is 1mm long. And it's in a bacterium that's 1μ. So the DNA has been folded up a thousand times. And the pictures that you see of a bacterium with a little circle in it are ridiculous.
>
> Furthermore, when you think that most of the bacterium is full of these ribosomes and that the correct picture is not that ribosomes move along the messenger, but the messengers, because the ribosomes are big... their diffusion is quite slow. But the messengers must be moving through the cell like a lot of... like a lot of hysterical snakes, threading their way through the ribosomes like this.
>
> And... and I've always thought of it as very good to try to get that picture over. I feel there's not enough done about this; people don't teach them some scales of anything and how molecules reach things and so on. And Francis... that's one of the things that we tried very hard to do: was to **stay imprisoned within the physical context of everything**.

## 67. Being a heretic got me to Cold Spring Harbor

> Milislav Demerec, who was Director of Cold Spring Harbor, visited Oxford in 1954 and got very excited about my heretical work on actual mutations. He asked me, "Won't you come to Cold Spring Harbor?" This opportunity led to my Carnegie Corporation Travelling Fellowship, and that is where I really got injected into the whole of modern science.

---

## 68. Overlapping triplet code: George Gamow's diamond code

> I did... I actually did experiments in Cold Spring Harbor, and actually wrote a... and I actually wrote a little paper from that work on... on tryptophan biosynthesis, which is very interesting. I had already started to think quite hard about the genetic code and it was then in that summer – this is 1954 – that when I arrived at Cold Spring Harbor I had already started to do my own research, theoretical research on this thing on what was called the overlapping triplet code. Very soon after Francis and Jim published their paper, George Gamow, who was a cosmologist and physicist, and who's renowned for his books on physics called *Mr Tompkins Meets the Universe* [sic] I think was one of them... George Gamow published a paper on a code for DNA. This was the so-called Diamond Code and... and it became clear that the standard problems of the code then were that there were 64 triplets, 20 amino acids, and so one had to do something to arrange these triplets in this form and Gamow provided one explanation.
>
> He thought basically that overlapping triplets... that is triplets overlapping by two would determine the code and he put it in... in a form which looked physical in the sense that he thought there were diamond shaped cavities on DNA which covered three bases and thought that the amino acids would fit into this and he showed there was a way of arranging these... these three bases, such there were 20 groups of them, and since this 20 came out to be the same as the number of amino acids, the natural amino acids, one thought **the magic number had been reached**, and that was the thing.

---

## 69. Overlapping triplet code: eliminating all overlapping triplet code

> So what this did was formulate the questions of the code for the first time in a really serious manner. The question became: could we test whether the code was overlapping? And that's where statistical analysis came in – using Poisson analysis to look at dipeptide frequency in known protein sequences. If the code was overlapping, then certain combinations of adjacent amino acids would be forbidden, and we could test this against actual protein data to eliminate all overlapping triplet code possibilities.

---

## 70. Seymour Benzer: the end of the classical gene

> Seymour Benzer's work was absolutely critical. His fine-structure mapping of the rII region of bacteriophage T4 really demonstrated that the gene was not indivisible – it had internal structure. This was the end of the classical gene concept. Before Benzer, people thought of genes as beads on a string, indivisible units of heredity. Benzer showed you could map mutations within a single gene, and that recombination could occur between points within the gene. This opened up the whole molecular analysis of gene function.

---

## 71. Main elements of modern molecular biology

> I've always felt that the three things that came together to create the modern period of molecular biology were, first of all, **Sanger's proof that proteins had a chemical structure** – that is, that there was a defined sequence of amino acids in a protein, which meant that there had to be information transfer to specify this.
>
> Secondly, the **Watson-Crick structure of DNA**, which showed immediately how information could be copied – the complementary base pairing gave you a mechanism for replication.
>
> And thirdly, what Francis called the **Sequence Hypothesis** – that the sequence of bases in DNA determines the sequence of amino acids in a protein. And with that came the genetic code, the table of transformation. And that really lays the groundwork for molecular biology.

---

## 72. Gamow: cracking the code

> Now, to go back to the... the coding... question, Gamow used to... lived in Washington, where he was a professor at the George Washington University. And I met Gamow at Wood's Hole that summer of 1954. I went up to Wood's Hole to... to visit Jim and Francis – they were there that summer – and Gamow was there as well, and Gamow was giving lectures on proteins. Gamow had a wonderful language. For example, his pronunciation you had to follow... oxytocin, he was a Russian so it was called ochitotzine, you see. Ah, vasopretzine, you see. So once... you had to get used to all of this, and Gamow had a completely... he got mixed up between cytosine and cysteine, and used the two terms interchangeably. So you had to really know the field to follow him.
>
> It used to be said that there were always sort of gentleman in... with crew cut hair and sober suits that came in to the back to the... Gamow's audience, who would be from the CIA or the National Security Council, who thought that they could crack this genetic code. And of course **cracking the code became the thing**.
>
> It is interesting to ask, to see the transformation of the use of the language, you see, because at the time the code was thought to be what we call the genome. Whereas what is the code is something that – and Francis has commented on this and... and – you know, we imagine it was something like the Morse Code, was a table. It said, you know; S dot, dot, dot, O dash, dash, dash, you see. And was a table of transformations and that we'd always thought of it in that way, and the famous table now of the genetic code is of course now done. Although you'll find that most people will still talk about the complete apparatus of the genome as the genetic code for an organism, and **that is wrong. It's the table of transformation**.

## 73. The annual phage meeting: Leó Szilárd

> During that summer I had... I was going to go across to... I'd spent the summer in Cold Spring Harbor; I met up with Jim, and there was the annual phage meeting...

---

## 74. Leó Szilárd

> Leó Szilárd was at that meeting, and this is where I met him. I was very impressed by him that with every talk that was given that he didn't like, he would get up; leave the front row. He would stand by the door for a few seconds to give the speaker another chance, and if he didn't, as was usually the case, he would then leave.

---

## 75. Caught in Hurricane Carol with James Watson

> I gave Seymour's paper at the Cold Spring Harbor meeting. And it had been arranged then that I was going to California to go to the Virus Lab and visit there, and it had been arranged then by Jim that I would go through... I would drive back with him across California and go to Pasadena.
>
> Jim had just learnt to drive and he had a Chevy convertible, and I had spoken to people that he'd driven across the States from the West Coast, who had had quite a hair-raising trip with Jim.
>
> Unknown to both of us, the famous hurricane Carolina... Caroline struck this coast, we had no radio, and so we drove into Boston to an appalling storm... there was a terrible storm that night, and I got up to find half the place was under water.
>
> The entire town was deserted. There was water everywhere. I'd never seen rain like this. We seemed to be the only people driving around. What we were doing is driving around the middle of the hurricane.
>
> It's only later that we discovered... that we were driving as the eye of the storm passed over Cambridge.

---

## 76. Coast-to-coast road trip with Jim Watson

> The first day we drove through New York State and we came to Albany. There was a tremendous storm and at the outskirts of Albany, Jim said, 'You drive'. Now, I'd never driven on the right hand side of the road. This was an absolute storm – lightning. I don't know how... where I was going. Never driven in America before. Somehow I drove through Albany without killing us, and finally we got to the other side and stayed the night in a motel and... with the two of us, and then the next day we drove to Chicago where I stayed a few days with Jim at his family home and met his family there.
>
> And then from there we went on to Urbana, where we stopped there for an afternoon – that's where I met Luria, Ed Lennox and all the people who were at Urbana – and then from Urbana we drove out west, stopping at various places. I can remember stopping in Colorado Springs after a day in which we'd been stopped by a traffic policeman in a small town in Kansas where they had a speed limit... a ridiculous speed limit like 25ft an hour. And I noticed this policeman tailing us and I said... I was driving, and I said to Jim, 'What do... what do we do?' So he says, 'Just drive', you know, so I drove extremely carefully, and just as we came to the border, the Colorado/Kansas border, this policeman stopped us. And he said, 'You went through a traffic light. Get out of the car... go through a traffic light.' I said, 'Well, I don't... I don't think I did, but if I did I'm terribly sorry', you see.
>
> However, it was very clear that he was trying to get us – this was a Friday, I remember – and Jim kept on saying, 'Don't argue with him, because he'll put us in jail and there'll be no judge till Monday, and we'll have to spend the weekend in jail'. So he asked to see my driver's licence. I showed him a South African driver's licence. He says, 'I see, you're out of state'. So I said, 'Yes'. So he then said to Jim, 'Are you the car owner?' 'Yes.' And then he went to look, and in California at that time the licence was wrapped around the steering wheel. And of course he read it and he said, 'Are you Mr Dewey?' Because Jim's middle name is Dewey – JD Watson. He was called after... by... his father had a great admiration for the philosopher Dewey at Chicago, and was called James Dewey Watson. He didn't like the name, and of course he didn't like the policeman calling him Mr Dewey. And I could see Jim getting very, very het up, and so I kept on saying to him, 'Don't talk back to him or we'll be in jail for the weekend'.
>
> However, we went to Colorado. I drove; I think a remarkable thing that... that made such an impression on me. I mean, having travelled a lot in South Africa, deserts and mountains, I mean, this was just fabulous, the scenery in the Rockies, and the desert scenery there... thereafter was so fascinating.

---

## 77. Preparing to die in the desert

> We then went through Monument Valley, which is where the four states meet, which is a desert, and it was hilarious because Jim said, 'You know, you can't get anything for 200 miles', or whatever it was, and he was... and, you know, he gave me pictures of disappearing there only, you know, to discover our bleached bones in the desert.
>
> And so while he... we went to a general store and while Jim was writing postcards to all his friends, you know, in Harvard saying, 'Farewell, we're about to embark on the desert', I who had travelled in deserts, you know, was getting equipped. That is, I bought an extra fan belt. This is the one thing; if you lose your fan belt you've had it. I actually bought water. I mean, Jim was buying ice cream, but I bought water. I bought canisters of water to take with me.
>
> I also bought a jar of... I think it was... it was butter, I think, that I got. Anyway, something that you could use on a piece of a shirt which you could coat to make a spare fuel pump. They had diaphragms in fuel pumps. I had been caught once with a collapsed fuel pump in a desert, and of course once that happens you've had it. And we made one out of a shirt and Vaseline, it... it was, which sort of held up. You know, got us to the next place.
>
> And of course all of this was just ridiculous. The desert was highly populated; you could get a Coke every now and then. The place was full of trucks of the Atomic Energy Commission, you know, collecting uranium. And so our great episode of landing up just as a pile of bleached bones never materialised.

---

## 78. Making plans with James Watson

> We talked... we talked a lot of science, you know. But at that stage everything was at the beginning and everything was plans... I remember discussing with Jim about RNA structure and approach – we had disagreements with Watson and Crick about how to tackle this. There was a Swedish biochemist anecdote that came up during our conversations.

---

## 79. The RNA Tie Club

> Well, of course at that stage you have to remember that in 1953, '54, this is what we're talking about – '52 and '53 and '54, it's this period I'm talking about – there were very few people that even knew what we were talking about... Gamow started the RNA Tie Club with its limited membership – **each member was assigned an amino acid as their code name**. This was a way of creating an informal network of scientists thinking seriously about the coding problem.

---

## 80. The 'old days' experiments

> We came to Cal Tech, and that again brought me in direct contact with the Phage Group – the Phage Church – at which I met many people there that had become... you know, had become... had become lifelong friends. We worked with protoplasts and phage at Berkeley's Virus Lab, applying biochemistry to these fundamental problems.

---

## 81. The gene protein problem

> I spent about eight weeks in... in the Virus Lab, and then of course the time came for me to go back. By this time I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I had formulated what had be... what we had come... was **the gene protein problem**. We were working with bacteriophages and tryptophan to understand how genetic information specified protein structure.

---

## 82. The decision to join the Cavendish Laboratory

> So I returned to South Africa in December of that year – it's '54 – with the idea that I would start to work on the genetics of cofactor requirement in order to prepare the way for a full gene protein analysis, and that is something that I could do in South Africa. And so I was extremely depressed when I left America, because at that time I thought: I'll never see it again. You know, that was the end of the... the end of everything.
>
> But of course there were already conversations, when I came back to South Africa on the way I went to England, and there I talked to Francis, and there... there we had this discussion on degenerate coding and templates, and there we had the idea that I would come to join them in the Cavendish because **we were talking the same language**. However, I had to go back to serve my bondage, and all the wheels would be done to try and bring me back as... as soon as possible.

---

## 83. Going to South Africa

> I returned to South Africa to establish a laboratory in the physiology department. I had plenty of space there and secured funding for phage cofactor genetics research. Working with minimal equipment and a local assistant named Betty van Zyl, I developed methods for obtaining recombinants and published my findings.
>
> I sent my manuscript to Max Delbrück, who organized a seminar to discuss the work. By 1954, I had developed theoretical proofs about triplet genetic codes, publishing "On the Impossibility of All Overlapping Triplet Codes" in PNAS, which I consider important work.
>
> There was concurrent correspondence with Francis Crick regarding the gene-protein problem and our plans to establish collaborative research at Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory, expecting contributions from American scientists including Seymour Benzer and George Streisinger.
>
> I received job offers from Berkeley (Gunther Stent), Wisconsin (Joshua Lederberg), and England before the MRC ultimately secured my position. I made the decision to leave South Africa – **one must test yourself at the international level** – and I recognized apartheid's implications for my future.

---

## 84. Fred Sanger on the structure of insulin

> There's a club in Oxford called the Alembic Club which was for the discussion of chemistry, and I can remember – I think it must have been either late '53 or early '54 but certainly while I was at Oxford – of going to a lecture that was given by Fred Sanger and was on the structure of insulin, and he showed how he deduced the structure. I know he had a wonderful set of little blocks which he turned over to face the audience as he determined the little pieces of a structure, and the thing that struck me, because of course protein structure then was in a total impossible thing, and the thing that really impressed me was at the end of this lecture **Sir Robert Robinson stood up and said the following. He said, 'Dr Sanger has made proteins part of chemistry. He's actually shown this remarkable fact that these things have a chemical structure in the form of their sequence of amino acids.'**
>
> And until that time, you know, no one actually believed it. They all thought that they were polymers and things just joined together. There's something called the Bergmann-Niemann Hypothesis which said that things occurred with a frequency according to their abundance so they were repetitive structures, which of course you can't do very well because many things would come to occupy the same position so you can't have something that occurs every second position and another thing every third position, because what happens at position number six? You have a conflict.
>
> However, that was the state, and that I think was another signal achievement in pushing the subject on. But of course you see that again wasn't something that most people were doing, and Fred himself was always a fringe person in the biochemistry department here in Cambridge, and it's only when Fred left the biochemistry department and joined with us to go up the hill to make the Laboratory on Molecular Biology, but that'll come later.

## 85. Growing bacteriophage in a Hoover washing machine

> Well I arrived in Cambridge. I arrived in Southampton again after a long trip, but this time with three children, with a three year appointment for the MRC at a salary of £1,100 a year. I can remember that. It wasn't a tenured appointment, it was a short-term appointment, and this was in the end of December 1956, and we arrived here in Cambridge to take up the appointment from 1st of 1957.
>
> And we had to find places to live – it was very, very difficult, I mean, just adapting to this. The laboratory had to be built up from scratch, there weren't any kitchens and so on, and in fact we set about organising a laboratory to do phage work. And our dish washing was in our office, and from that day... there were seven desks in this office, it was mixed up with crystallographers; we had a bench in a chemical lab, and a number of people were hired including Leslie Barnett. Leslie Barnett was then a computer girl, that... in those politically incorrect times this referred to people who actually did the calculations for crystallography on mechanical calculators and there was something known as **the three-girl method**; that is you got three girls to estimate the density and took the average of their estimation. So, I mean, it was that, and then she joined me, and... because she had a degree in biology... and Kate Wilkins joined us, who stayed with us, and she started to do our dish washing and our preparation.
>
> And we got a lab going so that by the time the gang arrived in 19... at the... in September of that year, I'd already done quite a lot of experiments, and we were able to do experiments and one of the things that we started to do – already we were doing then – was to work on bacteriophage. This bacteriophage could be grown on E. coli, and we did this because we could purify it very easily and we could get lots of it.
>
> And there were wonderful episodes of how we needed to grow large amounts of this, so I conceived of the idea of growing them in a washing-machine and there was a... because that had... there was a Hoover washing machine, I remember, which was... from the top, and had a pump which circulated everything and I thought: well, you know this is exactly what we need to grow large quantities of... of phage, because we could grow them in this and then we could inoculate them. And so I wrote to the Hoover company, they gave me a washing machine and... in which we grew things, and we could only grow them once, and then nothing grew and the reason for that unfortunately is that the phosphate media so corroded the aluminium that in fact the thing was just useless.
>
> But however it... it was developing all of these things to... to make the material and that is where I... that is also during this time I started to work with the electron microscope. Now the reason to do this was simply that I thought we could just take bacteriophage apart, you know, because it was like a little thing and we could do what we called an anatomical dissection of it. Whereas all the other people said, 'No you have to treat it as a mixture of proteins and go on to columns and separate them', so **the whole idea that you could actually isolate chunks of it as a preliminary was... was certainly something that no one accepted at the time**, and this, we were able to show, could be done, and we did it in very simple ways.
>
> For example I discovered that if you put bacteriophage at pH2 – just acidified it – it went into a mass, and when you digested it with a mixture of enzymes you were only left with one little component, namely what came to be called later was the tail sheath. And so we did a lot of experiments like this and then we could actually start to produce these... these pieces of the phage.

## 86. Taking the electron microscope out of the hands of the elite

> Now, one of the interesting things which happened during the time, and actually was a side-effect of all of this work, was **the invention of negative staining**. Now, this is a very remarkable... technology because what it did was it took electron microscopy out of the hands of the elite and gave it to the people, basically.
>
> Now in those days if you needed to do electron microscopy you needed to have a professional electron microscopist. This is someone who knew how to shadow things with uranium, and he would evaporate uranium onto these objects and put them on the machine so that you could actually visualise them. Because... of course the electron microscope can see small things but it needs contrast in order to see them and this... biological objects don't have enough contrast – you need some kind of heavy... heavier compound there, with more electrons, that is – and so shadowing was part of the profession, and these electron microscopists had to be pampered, and if you were, say, working in the life sciences you had to find a collaborator who of course exacted a very high price for this collaboration.
>
> And I started to work with... with someone called Bob Horne, who was a very interesting chap, was working with the electron micro... microscope in the solid state physics group here in the Cavendish and... and we had great difficulties in visualising these things and doing the shadowing; it was all terribly slow. So I decided – having come from a background of cytology – I would try and stain these. And... and so I knew you had to stain them with heavy metals, and so I got hold of phosphotungstic acid, and the first thing I did is I measured its pH, and I discovered its pH was three. So I said, 'I don't put biological objects into such acid conditions', so I neutralised it and I took all these pieces of virus, and I sprayed them onto this grid, and we took them over and we looked at them.
>
> Now Bob Horne said, 'That's a mess, it's a total mess; everything...' But then I saw something, and I knew immediately what it was, and I said, 'This is called negative staining'. And how did I know this? Because in my medical course I had learnt to show how you'd look at treponema. Treponema is the age... spirochaetes. Treponema is the agent that causes syphilis, and one of the things you diagnose is you put a drop on a slide and you put Indian ink in it, and you see the treponemas as white objects transmitting the lights, swimming in the sea of ink, and **this is called negative staining, and this was invented in the 19th century for the optical microscope and we... and I understood that this was the exact image of this, but for the electron microscope**, so with this we could produce remarkable images.
>
> And it had two effects. One is it allowed at least the electron microscopy of small objects to go. But what happened is it took all the people working in virology and gave them a tool that they could all use and really wiped out the profession of electron microscopist in a biological lab because everybody could just do it. And of course it's been the... it's been a wonderful technique, it's been developed by... by many people, but it's again... I mean, in that sense, it's... it's being able to say, **'This picture, I've seen something like this before'**, and of course now I know it's got to do with syphilis. Of course you can't explain to someone that this is where venereal disease comes in but it's effectively... it's the images that map on to each other.

---

## 87. Anecdotes from the MRC lab

> Now I didn't pursue virus structure myself, because it was just a means to getting to the phage, but of course that sort of revolutionised how people could look at particles of all sizes, and for us it was just a tool that was very important, because also it generated I think in biology the ability through – of course the phage work itself – to start to think now about macromolecular assemblies which I think have become the important underlying thing in cell biology. **The molecular biology of the cell is how bunches of molecules get together and interact** and this was one of the methods that could do it.
>
> However, we did go on and we had a hilarious time here. Seymour Benzer felt the cold very severely. In fact, he was ready to go home. He came in... in October, and they were so cold here he was ready to go home, but I dissuaded him. I used to come and make a fire for him, and, you know, help him to keep warm, but Seymour's the only person that I know walks around with a sweater in Death Valley, you know the temperature's 120°F, he's always been cold. He always likes to sleep late. He's an owl. That is, he stays up all night. I have in varying parts of my life been an owl and a lark, and sometimes both, that is get up early and go to bed late, but Seymour was this, and I remember they called me up... *Time Magazine* called me that year because Beadle won the Nobel Prize, and they called me from London, and they said could they speak to... to Dr Benzer, and I said, 'Dr Benzer is still asleep'.
>
> Then they said, 'Did I know where to find Doctor Garrod?' So I said, 'Just hold on a moment, I'll check up'. Now I have to tell you what this is about. This is Archibald Garrod who's thought... thought to be... you know who is the real founder of modern biochemical genetics, the physician who deduced alkaptonuria as a biochemical defect and of course had long since died, and what I went to look up was his obituary to see where he was buried, you see, and so I could give them directions to the Highgate Cemetery where I thought they might be able to get him. In fact, I said, **'You're probably more likely to wake him up than you are Seymour Benzer.'**
>
> So... so Seymour did this. Then Seymour, George and I and Sewell Champe, who was a student that Seymour brought with him for this, we decided to have a lunch club. It was... of course food in England was atrocious in those days. You had the choice between a bad Chinese lunch and a terrible Chinese lunch, so we decided we would form a lunch club and we would cook for each other. And one person would go around, collect all the ingredients and then make a meal which we would all eat and such was the impulse to outdo each other that in fact people would start cooking two days before – George in particular, who was a gourmet... George Streisinger was a gourmet, and he actually went to Yarmouth to get mussels one day, so we could have the moules marinière, and this got to the stage we're spending more time on preparing these grand lunches, and of course what happened was Seymour killed it all because he came in one day when it was his turn with a rather shy smile on his face and produced four packets of fish and chips, said he'd got up too late to prepare the lunch, so that was the end of the lunch.

## 88. The MRC lab at Cambridge: X-ray crystallography

> In Cambridge, the laboratory as it was then called in the '50s – the Unit, the MRC Unit for the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems – was focused on X-ray crystallography work. This was the foundation of structural biology, determining the three-dimensional arrangements of atoms in biological molecules.

---

## 89. The MRC lab at Cambridge: Computers and determining structures

> One of the things that John did which was absolutely very far-sighted was he realised computers were going to be very important in this field. The work in crystallography, determining the structure of myoglobin and other proteins, was computationally intensive. This was also when people working on muscle structure came to join us in the '60s.

---

## 90. Making mutant spectra with acid

> However, this was very exciting because we would be talking... saying, 'Well, we've got this gene, which is the R2...' We were doing chemical mutagenesis and proflavine experiments – trying to understand the nature of mutations at the molecular level.

---

## 91. Purifying tRNA

> Now, furthermore, at the same time, Francis had decided that, 'We've got to start working on protein synthesis and what we've got to do is to start working on these Transfer RNAs'. So he started together with... with John Littlewood and Mahlon Hoagland who came here in that great glorious year to start to see whether they could purify transfer RNA, and start to work on protein synthesis; and so, you know, this was the whole thing: could we prove the adaptor hypothesis? Could we decode this way?
>
> So we had all of these experiments going on and we had this wonderful group in that year. Seymour, George, Mahlon Hoagland. Mahlon Hoagland's great... great accomplishment that year was to perform the guitar in the Green Man pub in Grantchester. They still remember him there because he stayed in the house next door which is Byron Lodge and he still remembers this as well to become that.
>
> And... and now of course there were competitors in this field. That is having formulated this... this program, many people said, 'We'll do this as well', and one of the ones was Cyrus Leventhal and decided he'd also do a gene protein problem and he would do it with a bacterial gene. So it'd become... that is, he would do it with alkaline phosphates; they could purify this, they could do this. There were other people working with bacteriophage and of course the... the other person who did it as well, later on, was Charles Yanofsky but Charles Yanofsky is a very interesting man in that he decided to work on tryptophan biosynthesis as a graduate student, starting with David Bonner, and he's just worked on that all of his life and fed into this whatever problems emerged.
>
> So he didn't start from this other end and that's different you see because we said, 'You have to get a system to prove this', and of course that I think is also very important and something which of course you learn, and something which I think is... is absolutely still important today and I'm still doing it which is that **once you've formulated a question, and if it's general enough, it means you can solve it in any biological system. So what you want to do is to find experimentally which is the best one to solve that problem** and as long as it's general enough you will find the solution there and **the choice of the experimental object remains one of the most important things to do in biology** and which sort of is, I think, one of the great places to do innovative work.

## 92. Purifying tRNA (Part 2)

> And so you have to say, 'Well, you know the diversity is so large...' We discussed bacterial protein research, cytochrome c discovery, and genetic pattern formation work. We worked with Fred Sanger's department exploring developmental genetics.

---

## 93. The first official use of Molecular Biology

> Now, at about this time, we had space problems in the Cavendish. A new professor had been appointed – that was Nevill Mott. It was very clear that with the crystallography developing then, because that's Max and John Kendrew had started to solve myoglobin and haemoglobin, that this unit – which had been called up to that point the unit for the Macro... the Molecular Structure of... of Biological Systems – that that couldn't last in the Cavendish, and that it would have to find some future home.
>
> And many things were explored. For example, at one time we explored the following possibility that the physicists – that is, the crystallography – would stay in the Cavendish, and that Francis and myself and our group, we would go to the genetics department, and Francis effectively applied for the Chair of Genetics here and was turned down. **Francis Crick was not thought to know anything about genetics**. Seymour tells a nice story about this as well when Fred Sanger came to Purdue University where Seymour was there to give his insulin lecture. Seymour came up to him and said, 'Oh you're... you come from Cambridge'. He said, 'Do you know Francis Crick?' To which Fred replied, **'Crick? Oh yes, he's the fellow who's rather keen on genes.'** But Francis was not thought to know anything about them even if he was keen on them to warrant being appointed a professor here.
>
> So we then explored possibilities of going into chemistry. That wouldn't work. Then the MRC said they'd make a building for us. We then tried to get a central site here because in those days in Cambridge you wanted to be in the centre, and it was a very active thing. People were in and out of each other's laboratories, the pubs around in this area were... you could always go in there and meet people from the Molteno Institute to the biochemistry department, so it was... it was like a... it was a real intellectual centre, but we could not actually survive here without getting some expansion.
>
> And so we tried to find a central site. I think one was found but it was discovered the land didn't belong to them and the university were not very interested in keeping us. And the MRC's first idea was they'll put all the MRC groups together and that will have taken us with certain people we didn't want to have and we told them no. What we think they ought to do is to do something in molecular biology. By this time, I think it was 1958 or 1959, **we had changed the name of our unit – we called it Molecular Biology**.

*[Q] From?*

> From the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems, and so **that is the kind of first official use of that word** although it had been used before as history has shown – Astbury... we used it some time ago – but in fact this science of molecular biology with its curious combination of chemistry, crystallography and genetics, you know, had been created at that point. And that's about the time the *Journal of Molecular Biology* got created and of course we were going to get this laboratory.

## 94. Genetics of the rII and the gene protein problem

> Well, during this period we were doing many things simultaneously, one of the things was the genetics of the R2; the other was trying to work on the gene protein problem. Now, the gene protein problem went ahead, and one of the things we discovered is that the protein that was very easy to purify in very large amounts was the head protein of the bacteriophage. **The amazing thing is that when one studied what happened after infection with this bacteriophage, this single protein accounted for 70% of all the protein synthesis of the cell**.
>
> Now, what you have to understand is that at that time it was believed that the ribosomes carried the information from the gene to the protein. That is the RNA of the ribosomes was the material that was so to speak the information intermediate. But already a lot of experiments seemed to make that very questionable.
>
> One of the experiments that created some concern was a whole set of analyses of the RNA of bacteria and of the DNA bacteria and it had been known for some time and strongly reinforced during this period that whereas the base composition – that is the amount of G + C to A + T – varied in bacteria over an enormous range. That is, they were bacteria whose DNA was 3/4 (G + C), down to bacteria whose DNA was 3/4 (A + T). That paradox was accompanied by a complete invariance of the RNA. The RNA seemed to have about the same base composition in all the bacteria.
>
> This gave rise to a lot of problems because, as you can see, if the DNA is supposed to carry the message, why did it vary so much? You would have thought that the language of the code was pretty invariant. Now there were two kinds of theories to get out of this. One was the DNA of bacteria was made up of two kinds. One was invariant and looked like the DNA—the composition of the RNA; and the other was variable, in fact it was just a lot of junk. Now **the Junk Hypothesis had to be discarded** when Doty and Sueoka showed that the dispersion of the DNA of this base composition was homogeneous.
>
> That is it was finely dispersed. They did this by measuring the density of the DNA and it's known that the density of G + C is different from the density of A + T. If the Junk Theory was correct you would have expected that DNAs from different bacteria would split into two fractions. One which corresponded to the bulk analysis, and then one smaller fraction which would have been the genes, and what they found is that the DNA base composition of the whole went down to rather small regions of DNA homogeneously.
>
> So that means that it was there, and of course this gave rise to the concept that in fact the code may be degenerate in some form. In fact Sinsheimer did make a suggestion of this, that essentially the code would have to be a pyrimidine purine code and not depend on which purine or this, so he did make a suggestion of a Binary Code. That of course is wrong, but I mean that is what we had to face. But what we could not explain is why is the base composition of the ribosomes invariant.

## 95. DNA and RNA synthesis

> So if you believe that... and with our work on... on bacteriophage, because of course we started to look at the head protein, and started to look for mutations controlling this, but this business of this prodigious synthesis was something that we knew had to be explained. Furthermore, it was known that after phage infection no bacterial proteins were made and so the phage then captured the bacteria for its own purposes.
>
> If you believe that the ribosomal RNA carried the information from gene to protein you would have to explain the rate by... by there being new ribosomes being made after phage infection. Since this occupied 70% of the protein synthesis for one protein, then at least an equal number of new phage ribosomes should have to be made. **The difficulty was that after phage infection no new ribosomes are made, there's no RNA synthesis**, and so what you had is if you wished to hold the old theory you had to have what I called at that time **the paradox of the prodigious rate of protein synthesis**. That is, you had to say, 'Well there could be a few new ribosomes made, they would have escaped your attention, but clearly these very few were capable of prodigious rates of function'.
>
> Well, people... other people were working on this question of RNA... of information transfer at the time and some years before two workers called Volkin and Astrachan had discovered a small fraction of RNA synthesis made after phage infection which had what is called the apparent base composition resembling that of the DNA.
>
> Now, the apparent base composition is done because when one hydrolyses RNA for its analysis you transfer the phosphate group from the group into... by which it entered the DNA into the adjacent neighbour. Therefore the apparent base composition would be the same as the real base composition if what we called the Digram Structure were random, that is any nucleotide could follow any other nucleotide on the average at... at the abundance they were in the... in the messenger.
>
> Volkin and Astrachan actually thought that this was an intermediate in DNA synthesis and **the mystery of Volkin-Astrachan DNA lingered on** there and of course you couldn't be too sure that there were a small fraction of cells that were doing this, that had escaped the block of phage synthesis.

## 96. François Jacob and Jacques Monod

> At the time then there was a... other people had begun to work on this RNA being made after phage infection and in fact there was a paper in which it had been suggested that this new RNA was in fact found in the presence of a small number of new ribosomes, and that got published later, and that everything was all right.
>
> Following... at the same time people working in Paris – this would be **François Jacob and Jacques Monod** – had come to realise that one could... one needed something special to explain enzyme induction. They had been studying the kinetics of enzyme induction after you add the gene to a cell and found that this happened extremely rapidly, and in fact by using various inhibitors they produced a number of alternatives, all of which just seemed quite strange.
>
> For example one of their alternatives was that the DNA for these enzymes made protein directly. There was no intermediate. But they were... they seemed to have excluded the possibility that new ribosomes were made to carry this, or if they were, they were a very small fraction and again capable of prodigious synthesis.

---

## 97. Volkin-Astrachan RNA and Phage

> I had got to meet François Jacob in the late '50s when I went to Paris to give a lecture on bacteriophage... We discussed the PaJaMo Experiment and the mystery of how information was transmitted from DNA to protein. This led us to thinking about messenger RNA.

## 98. Experimenting in California

> This meeting took place. By the afternoon François had come to my house in Cambridge, and we had designed the nature of the experiment that was later to be produced; that is, **we realise we have to show... have to show that this new RNA is on old ribosomes** and we... I realised very immediately that this could only be done on bacteriophage where we have the switch from old to new synthesis.
>
> And how would we tell the difference between old and new? Well, we would do it by the tricks developed by Meselson and Stahl which had... they'd developed for DNA. Namely we would label these with heavy isotopes – that is with Carbon 13, Nitrogen 15 – and we would be able by density gradient centrifugation just to weigh them and discover whether they were old or new, and that's one thing to say all of that and another thing to do it.
>
> Of course, the people who had all the amino acids made with the heavy isotopes were in California – that was Matt Meselson. I had learnt that François was going to go to California that summer, had been invited there, and what had happened was that I had been invited to come to California – another reason, and so we fixed it that we would go and do this experiment in California in... in the following June; it's a couple of months, and I fixed it with Matt Meselson we'd be able to use his isotopes and his equipment.

## 99. Experiments with 'Tape RNA'

> I then started to do some preliminary experiments here, and I did an experiment which was never published but in fact is quite an interesting experiment, because it proved that no new ribosomes could be made and this experiment which... which involves the following. If you take bacteria and starve them of magnesium, then after a long period of time – they remain viable – they lose their ribosomes and they destroy them and they turn them over, and that means that when you start 'em up again, by giving them a good medium, they have to take a long time to make new ribosomes to get going.
>
> So what I said, 'Well, I'll do a quickie'. That's an... that's an experiment which you'll see if you're on the right grounds because if it is true that new ribosomes are made after phage infection, my destroying the old ones wouldn't have any... any effect, and they should just take off and do the same thing. Was absolutely... the experiment was beautifully clear because the fewer the ribosomes that you have as they destroy... so you let... you destroy them, you then infect them at different periods, and you ask how much virus can you make, and it goes down, and it goes down, and there comes a point where you don't make anything because of course after phage infection you don't make any ribosomes. So that said... you know, then I knew I have to be right.
>
> And then we went to California to do this experiment and that was a hilarious story which has been told by François because you go to do quite a difficult experiment – I mean, it's technically quite complex – and I have to do it in three weeks, and I didn't even know whether it would work, even if we could get it to work. And one of the terrible things is that everything started to fall apart in the density gradient. The ribosomes were not stable and so every experiment failed. These experiments were awful; they took a lot of expensive isotope, and you didn't know the answer until you had run it in a centrifuge for a day, and of course if anything went wrong, if the centrifuge broke down, it was really terrible. So kind of getting this through to the end in an intact form was... was a thing, and every experiment we did didn't work, and I remember people saying, 'Well, you know, you're... it's going to take a year's work of exploratory, you know, normal science, to do this', and one of the amusing things was of course Max Delbrück didn't believe this hypothesis of the unstable intermediate.
>
> **We called it messenger RNA there, but we had another name for it; we called it Tape RNA** – it was called that for a short while – just being the idea that the ribosomes were like players, you know, like a tape player, and you fed them with tape. Actually, in my mind that was the old Turing machine you see. You fed a tape into this machine and it would play out its results, so it was called tape, and it was the whole idea of a message tape, and that of course strikes one now today as obvious that that would be the analogy. But then it was a very... you know, very dramatic thing, and Max Delbrück... I said to François... I said, 'You know we're fine'. He said, 'Why?' I said, **'Max doesn't believe in it'. Because Max was marvellous; he was always wrong**.
>
> There are marvellous stories told about Max. George Streisinger tells a story in his... in his essay on Max Delbrück that effectively he was met coming out of Max's office looking very depressed and someone said, 'What's the matter?' He says, **'Max likes my theory; it must be wrong'**. So the whole idea of doing... so I told François, 'Don't bother, Max thinks it's wrong, it must be right, you see', so we had a tremendous episode – this has been told – but one of the interesting things was where do you go from this?

## 100. Using magnesium to compete with caesium: radioactive Coca-Cola

> Some of the things I tried then were... were quite interesting, you see. For example, because the caesium chloride we were using to centrifuge these ribosomes was, what we say, 8 molal. That's almost like molar but not quite but you can imagine that it's 8 moles of the salt – that's very, very strong salt – and salt has to be soluble, and of course I discovered that there're bacteria that they'd got out of the Dead Sea that liked to live in 4 molar salt. So we think, why don't we try these, you know, because these will be ribosomes that like a lot of salt, so I actually got them you know, but of course we couldn't have done the experiment because they weren't sensitive to our bacteriophage, and in the end one had to do it with this.
>
> And the dramatic thing which is recounted is just lying on a beach there because we had gone out to the beach to kind of rest our weary souls; this was the last chance and I had felt... we felt it's all over, you know – we now have to settle down to a year of really boring analysis and conditions and so on; and then it occurred to me that of course, you see, **it is magnesium that stabilises this, and the caesium will compete with the magnesium** – not very efficiently, but enough to displace it and unstabilise it. And of course the magnesium we were putting in was a thousandth molar, the caesium we had was 8 molar; therefore the thing to do is to raise the magnesium.
>
> And of course I didn't give this argument but as recounted I sprang up and said, 'It's the magnesium, it's the magnesium', and of course, you know, François didn't know what was going on, but he went, and of course we ran back to the lab and we raised the magnesium. We said, 'How much?' I said, 'Let's do a lot', you know because you have three tubes and we said this is the last chance. So I said, 'Put in a lot, can do no harm'. So he said, 'Hundredth molar?' I said, 'All right but let's have one with tenth molar in, you know, we'll just go another 10'.
>
> So we put this in; we set up the experiment. François was so nervous he dropped the radioactive P-32 in the water-bath, and we hid the water-bath behind the Coca-Cola machine so that they couldn't find it because it was now very radioactive. In fact, I did come up... I then came several years later to Cal Tech, and I said, 'Could I have a Coke please?' And they said, 'Oh yes'. I said, 'Is the machine still in the basement?' I wanted to see if this water bath was still there. It wasn't there, but, you know, clearly it... it was safe after a few months.
